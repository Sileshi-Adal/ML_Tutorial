    "As we have seen in the previous rounds, machine learning (ML) methods combine particular choices for features, labels, hypothesis space (of predictor functions) and loss function (that measures the quality of a particular predictor function). See **Chapter 3** of the course book to see how many popular ML methods are obtained as particular combinations of some hypothesis space and some loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, we can freely choose a hypothesis space (model) and loss function for a given ML problem. However, in practice we have to restrict the hypothesis space to a subset of predictor functions to cope with **limited  computational resources**. Since existing computing hard- and software is very efficient in implementing matrix operations, a popular choice for the hypothesis space is the subset of linear functions $h(\\mathbf{x})= \\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$. Another important family of hypothesis spaces is obtained from decision trees. We have seen in Round 3 how sufficiently large decision trees allow to represent more complicated functions than linear functions. \n"

    "Consider a ML problem revolving around the prediction of a numeric quantity (label) $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ based on some features $\\mathbf{x}=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of a data point. At our disposal are some labeled data points which collect into the set $\\mathbb{X} = \\{ \\big( \\mathbf{x}^{(i)},y^{(i)}\\big)\\}$. Each data point is characterized by features $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ and a label (quantity of interest) $y^{(i)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we came up with some predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})$ which works extremely well on the dataset $\\mathbb{X}$,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{\\big(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)},y^{(i)}\\big) \\in \\mathbb{X}}\\big(y^{(i)} - \\underbrace{h(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})}_{= \\hat{y}^{(i)}}\\big)^{2}\\approx 0.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})$ does exceptionally well on the data set $\\mathbb{X}$, we can not be sure that the method will work well on new data points (different from the data points in $\\mathbb{X}$). \n",
    "This is particularly true for ML methods that allow for highly complicated predictor functions $h(\\mathbf{x})$. Examples of highly complicated predictor functions are linear functions $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x} = \\sum_{r=1}^{n} x_{r} w_{r}$ using a large number of features $x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}$ (the number $n$ of features is a measure of the complexity of the space of linear functions). It can be shown that if the number of features linear predictors on data points with $n$ features allows to perfectly fit any set of $m$ labels $y^{(i)}$ whenever $m \\leq n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example for a vast hypothesis space is given by the set of all predictor functions that can be represented by a given deep neural network structure with billions of adjustable weights (each edge has one weight $w$ that can be tuned). When using an extremely large hypothesis space $\\mathcal{H}$, it is very likely that just by chance one finds a predictor function $h(\\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that perfectly fits (reproduces) a given set of labeled data points (unless this dataset is VERY large). \n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods that perform well on training data due to memorization of the training data do not pick up any intrinsic relation between features $\\mathbf{x}$ and label $y$. Such a ML method merely overfits the training data and will not be able to **generalize well** to new data. \n",

    "Based on the above plot, we could argue that we should choose the linear model with $r=10$ features, since this yields the lowest training error $E(r)$. **This reasoning is incorrect**, since our ultimate goal is to find a predictor for new data points (new real-estates). Our goal is not to reproduce accurately the prices of previous house sales! \n",

    "Using the training error $E_{\\rm train}(r)$ to assess the quality of the predictor $h_{\\rm opt}^{(r)}$ is misleading since $h_{\\rm opt}^{(r)}$ is based on the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ and intercept that is perfectly tuned to the training data $\\mathbb{X}^{(t)}$. Also, the more features (larger $r$) we use, the better we will be able to fit the training data $\\mathbb{X}^{(t)}$ (obtain smaller training error). However, this does not necessarily lead to better performance on new data. A complex model with too many features (large $r$) might only fit the training data very well, and generalize poorly to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of $r=m_{\\rm train}$, i.e., the number of features is the same as the number of labeled data points in the training set. Under very mild conditions it can be shown that in this case there always exists a linear predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$ such that $y^{(i)} = h(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$, i.e., the training error is exactly zero (see Chapter 7.1 of the course book)! \n",

    "In general, there is no unique optimal way of splitting a data set into training and validation set. The precise choice of how to divide data points into training and validation set and also their relative size (80/20, 50/50 ...) has to be considered case-by-case for the application at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get more guidance on how to split the data, one typically needs to have additional knowledge about the statistical properties of the data generating process. Given an accurate probabilistic model for the data points, allows determining optimal split ratios between training and validation set. Probabilistic (generative) models for the observed data points is beyond the scope of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using only a single split of the data into training and validation set bears the risk of being extremely \"unlucky\". The single split might result in a highly non-typical validation set such that the validation error is not reliable as a measure for the average loss on new data. $K$-fold cross-validation is a straightforward extension of the \"single-split approach\" making it more robust. \n",
    "\n",
    "$K$-fold cross-validation randomly splits the data into $K$ equal-sized subsets (\"folds\"). It then executes $K$ rounds, each round corresponding to one of the $K$ folds. In the $k$th round, the $k$th fold is used as validation set and the remaining $K-1$ folds are used as training set. The validation errors obtained during each fold are then averaged to obtain the final validation error. \n",
