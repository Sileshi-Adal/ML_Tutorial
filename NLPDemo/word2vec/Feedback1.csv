Q01_Best part	Q02_Worst part	Q03_Time
'I liked all the jupyter excercises. I haven''t been doing python for years and It gives you a good basic understanding of numpy&nbsp;'	'I don''t like describing matrix qualities like is A^TA always invertible&nbsp; etc. since I don''t have a good intuition about the stuff'	2 : 1-5 hours
'The second coding exercise was pretty good in getting used to using the plot functions in python because I''ve never coded using python before. There still could be some brief introduction to using the required libraries, but I guess most people taking the course have used python a lot already. Getting myself to start the round took some time as I was afraid I   wouldn''t be able to code anything in Python but after getting started it   wasn''t all that bad'	The course introduced the machine learning concepts in a more complicated way than necessary in my opinion. Sometimes using the mathematical notations can be useful, but if people focus too much on trying to figure out the used notation the discussed topic may just go out of the other ear.	3 : 6-10 Hours
JupyerHub. Much easier than setuping by myself. Also book was really good in explaining stuff.	-0	4 : 10-20 hours
getting introduction to numpy	Using jupyter	2 : 1-5 hours
I have encountered eigenvectors a couple of times before. Perhaps it is the repetition and that they were already familiar, but I think the python exercise of plotting them on the data plot illustrates them really well.	'The questionnary had a couple of questions that felt like trick questions. Especially the one about invertible matrices with full rank and linear independency was very hard and came out of the blue.Another bad thing is asking about typos in the timed questionnaire. If I am limited time for the quiz I don''t have the motivation to seek out the typos I noticed in material. Some of the upcoming questions might&nbsp;take a lot of time so I can''t waste it. Also if I retake the quiz, should I then retype the whole answer again and again. It does not feel like the right place for such a question. Here in this feedback form I could give them though.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Exercises about data manipulation, covariances etc. using numpy. I have not used numpy before and have heard that it is a very powerful tool.	I did not find anything to complain about, really.	2 : 1-5 hours
I really liked the exercises because I have not used python before (I have experience from other languanges) and I was amazed by the amount of libraries made for python and how easy they were to implement. 	I did not like general instructions. They could have been more clear. For example I had a problems understanding why&nbsp;jupyterhub is used and for what. Not a big problem though.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Programming exercise part was fun to work as it helped me to learn new features of python.	Understanding section 2.3 of the course book proved a bit too difficult and I could not properly get the idea about loss function from the book.	4 : 10-20 hours
I thought the third excercise was the best since it refreshed my memory on working with matrices and using the numpy matrix functions. The visualization part was also pretty neat.	I was hoping the round would go a bit further into machine learning since I am already quite familiar with the basic math behind the concepts from my earlier studies, but I fully understand that many people have much less earlier experience.	3 : 6-10 Hours
How to use ML to recognize apples from drawings. It was nice subject and very well presented.	Quiz for round 1 because if you made a single mistake it will take points from you if you try it twise and second time you get it right.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
The reading material was pleasant to study. The hypothesis space section could be more focused on one subject in the cases. What follows are the topics of the ch 2.2 in order:&nbsp;Rumba,&nbsp;Shazaam (though presented in exercise-type box. Might be labeled as such, also),&nbsp;Python,&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptocurrencies&nbsp;Rumba. Managing the different topics made focusing in the subject matter a bit difficult. No other complaints :)	The quiz portion, where I got to retrace the found typos in reading material. I would have appreciated heads up on that. I never found the last spotted one..	2 : 1-5 hours
At this point, the exercises were easy, but the coding example in jupyter was well made and made completing the coding tasks very snappy. Usually it takes hours to set up coding environments just for specific courses.	The quiz was a bit stressing. I was worried if I made something differently in my code and it would be different in the right answer. Also I didnt find matrix material from jupyter, so I had to study the matrix stuff from wikipedia at the same time I took the quiz.	2 : 1-5 hours

Good lecturer	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
Python exercises were nice: clear instructions, good difficulty level, concrete results	'Theoretical questions about properties of matrices. I''d rather focus on the intuition of ideas before sucking the fun out of it with linear algebra'	4 : 10-20 hours
Basic introduction to the Python tools to be used during the course.	'The quiz questions about the properties of Gramian matrices came a bit out of the blue and was definitely not easy to find information about, until you figured out that the matrix X^T X was called Gramian matrix. Even then it required quite the digging, and unfortunately the question''s and the matrix properties'' significance to the course was not explained (I''m guessing the linear independence is the point: if the matrix is not invertible, it means some feature(s) is (/are) a linear combination of another/other feature(s), and is therefore redundant, and can/should be removed).'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The Jupyter notebook is great. It allows the student to test out the concepts in a programmatical way without too much hassle of setting up everything on their own.	Even if the Jupyter notebook was great, the exercise instructions could have been better. First, I thought that you were supposed to return them. So I kind of overdid a lot of unnecessary stuff. And spent time figuring out how to print stuff out nicely in Jupyter. Well, now I know how to make nice returns with Jupyter if needed...	3 : 6-10 Hours
Course book was concise and easy to follow	Reasoning about matrix properties was a bit too difficult	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked very much how tasks 2 and 3 gave a couple examples of mathematical tools that can be used to visualize how they can be used to "see" things in data. This visual example was useful for me. Jupyterhub is also a very pleasant way to do these exercises.	'Task 0 didn''t help me too much to get a grasp of numpy. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html was useful for me as I have used Matlab.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
It was easy to get started with the provided, plug-and-play Jupyter notebooks.	'There''s not enough exercises. It would be nice to have some optional, bonus stuff to improve ones grade.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked how the coding assignment is really easy and fast to do in the online environment JupyterHyb.	'Because I don''t have long history with coding, first I had some difficulties to get my code running without errors. The errors were raised by&nbsp;raise &nbsp;NoImplementedError. Luckily my friend said that I can just erase it and the problems disappeared.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Getting an understanding of the basic implementation schemes and understanding the concepts in practice.	Was pretty straight forward	2 : 1-5 hours
I guess the best part of this round is to refresh about linear algebra, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, which will later support PCA analysis on this course.	'Well, it''s a bit shocking to see report any typos in Section X of the textbook in a quiz. Initially, I thought that''s a real question and put the textbook back under my radar simply for typos...actually there''s no value added to report typos during very time-limited quiz hour.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The lectures.First, the lectures started from very beginning what ML is and reached a point that how a simple ML problem is formed.Second, they are also provided through videos. It gives the possibility of going through them also later and check for the details.	The assignments.I have programming experience but not much familiar with the Python language. Thus, going through the assignments and writing the correct code was a big challenge for me.I did not have time to go to the exercise garages and I needed some help anyway!Would that be possible if you provide us with some books that teach us the basics of Python for self-learning?I searched a lot but there are many books on Internet and not all of them are suitable for beginners.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the simple and straight-forward examples! Apples ftw!	'I feel like the lecturer lost some people on the intuition of why we need concepts such as loss functions and gradient descent. Once you get it it''s excellent but it''s sort of a mental jump for people not well-versed in machine learning!'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I am not familiar with the syntax used in python so I was delighted to see that it was somewhat similar to matlab. Therefore for example the 1st example was great and also splitting the data etc. Overall I would have liked to have more of these introduction exercises as I am not familiar with python.	I was at the garage and the assistant changed some of the given example code as the original one was giving some strange errors for me. It still dont understand how should I know if my code is correct or not which could be problem now and later.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Well, funnily enough, I liked that you asked about the concepts, the features, labels and so on. As machine learning is such a fast paced area, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the big picture, to see forest for the trees.	Keeping in mind that everything is relative, I think the worst part was some of the matrix stuff. Without solid foundation in it, it was difficult to see *why* certain features were important.	2 : 1-5 hours
-0	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
Python libraries. I have not used before pandas or matlib and I founded them quite useful in the future. I also liked JupiterHub as learning environment.	"Features" and "labels". I think terminology is absurd. In enywhere else we would use terms such as "sensor data" and "insights" or "inputs" and "outputs"	4 : 10-20 hours
All were good basic introductions to used tools	All were good basic introductions to used tools	2 : 1-5 hours
The initial exercises were on a good level on their difficulty since they allowed for a small initial refresher on certain topics.	I feel like the system with the quiz and programming exercises is kind of wonky, although I guess it works as a temporary solution.	2 : 1-5 hours
Tough question for me, I really liked the whole exercise round. There is something inherently interesting and fun to me with simply being able to combine programming and mathematics	'Didn''t have such as I liked the whole round. The difficulty and everything felt just right. Knew some stuff beforehand but also had to learn some new things and do revising.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The best part of this round was exercise 3. It was a good recap of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as I have not been studying these issues for a long time.	The worst part of this round was exercise 1, because the things covered in this exercise were already familiar to me and therefore it was quite useless.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The eigenvector exercise was the best part, because it reminded me that I should brush up on my matrix algebra	Question 2 in the quiz was the worst part, because I did not feel like I learned anything substantial doing that	2 : 1-5 hours
'General introduction to features, labels and hypothesis space. I''ve had courses previously that used machine learning concepts, but this time I think I finally understood what do they actually mean.'	'Question 11 in the quiz was a bit misleading. I just picked the one that I got from running the python code, I didn''t consider scaling the same vectors with scalar number.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Learning about scatter plots and such seemed interesting	'There wasn''t information provided on how to use the provided libraries. I don''t know whether this was by intent.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Using cryptocurrency as an example was interesting as it has been quite a hot topic in general lately.	Chapter 2.2 Hypothesis space needed to be read a couple of times before understanding the concept. Might not be the worst part of this round but definitely the toughest for me at least.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Python exercises are well designed.	Hypothesis space is quite difficult to understand as a concept.	2 : 1-5 hours
I think real world examples of possible features in Roomba-case were highly valuable in understanding the concept-	I am still not quite sure how hypothesis space is formed.	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 2. Files.	Task 1 - Plotting.	2 : 1-5 hours
The basics of machine learning were explained well.&nbsp;	No worst part in this round.	2 : 1-5 hours
Well, I liked the whole excercise, but one of the best parts was the numpy refresher.	Task 3 had some differences in the text and the coding section (task 3.2). Also using as_matrix gives "FutureWarning: Method .as_matrix will be removed in a future version. Use .values instead."	2 : 1-5 hours
The best part of this round was the&nbsp;topic of hypothesis space. It clarified the basics of machine learning for me and opened a new world of science and problem-solving.	The worst part was the matrix exercise in the very beginning. That is mainly because it was too easy and did not force to refresh the basic concepts of matrix calculations. Although, it is understandable because that exercise was more like numpy&nbsp;introduction.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The python exercise was really good part, since it taught me the basics of numpy and panda libraries.&nbsp;	Maybe there would should have been a brief tutorial of the basics of numpy and panda. Now i had to google the needed functions (which was not a bad thing to be honest).	2 : 1-5 hours
Intro to pandas and numpy.	Can not think any.	2 : 1-5 hours
Questions about invertibility of the matrix and the eigenvector exercises were the best in my opinion. The reason is that this forced me to recall some intuitions about these basic but essential linear algebra topics.	'I still don''t get what Sample Covariance matrix actually means in an intuitive manner.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'It''s great the lectures can be viewed online, due to work I''m not able to attend them otherwise.'	-0	2 : 1-5 hours
The example graphs during the lecture were very illustrative (e.g. loss function)	The first part of the exercise quiz had nothing to do with the python exercise "Task 0 - Matrices and Vectors".	3 : 6-10 Hours
The jupyter exercises had clear instructions, and no time had to be spent to actually figure out the goal.	Feature length: The lecture slides were easy to misunderstand as saying that d was the combined lenght of all features, while the coursebook stated it was lenght of a single feature.	2 : 1-5 hours
Overall the book chapters was very helpful to gain a basic understanding of the subject.	'Hmm haven''t really got any... Maybe the programming assignments could have been more difficult?'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Lecture material was quite clear.	-0	4 : 10-20 hours
Loss functions. Just an interesting topic overall.	Would be a bit artificial. All good stuff.	2 : 1-5 hours
'Everything linked to eachother, so it''s hard to have preferences.'	Same as above.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The "which plot matches the one you got" type of questions. Answering is fast and easy if you already took the time to complete the assignments.	'The questions about typos in the material. The are no points for them, the time limit will restrict any effort to look for typos, and I sure as heck can''t remember if there were typos or not in the N amount of pages I read. Maybe ask that in the feedback rather than in the actual quiz.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Overall the jupyter notebook was good and fun doing	'Some questions in the quiz didn''t reflect the notebook'	2 : 1-5 hours
Loss functions were intuitive and explained in not too verbose manner.	'Hypothesis space was explained with excruciating verbosity that might''ve made it more difficult understand.&nbsp;'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Basic python operations were useful regarding the course work ahead.	Hard to say which was worst. No idea.	2 : 1-5 hours
Python coding, it had the right amount of hints how to use the libraries.	'Question about the number of elements of the hypothesis space, I didn''t quite get how it is calculated. Hypothesis space in general.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The visualization of data in the exercises.	Nothing.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the notebook exercises, because they were just a nice and gentle introduction to relevant python libraries.	'I don''t think any part was really bad, the first round was very well done. If I had to name one, I''d say the reading materials, because there were a lot of terminology which are pretty hard to remember.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Features.&nbsp;In the beginning of the first lecture, I did not really understand what features are and how to characterize them, but after some repetition during the lecture and reading the book, it was made clear. It is really good to repeat the definitions during the lecture because when everything is new it might be hard to remember all the definitions, so it is much easier to understand the rest of the concepts if the definitions are repeated, exactly what was done in both the first and second lecture. Also the examples are very good, it makes everyhting much more understandable.	The hypothesis space and the utilization of loss function.This was my opinion before the second lecture, when I did not yet know how to "use" the loss funciton. After the second lecture, it was clearer how to get the correct hypothesis and I think after reading the section in the book it will be even clearer,	4 : 10-20 hours
coding, helps put theory into practice	matrices, always trouble	3 : 6-10 Hours
A good recap on vector/matrix math, as well as computation and plotting with python. 	'The course material used robot vacuum Rumba as an example, which is extremely annoying considering the whole Artificial Intelligence course also used Rumba as an example all the time. Having some more interesting and varying example use cases would really make the reading a lot more exciting and engaging. I don''t think anyone would be excited after reading about Rumba for hours and hours.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'Exercise two was a good reminder on how to visualise data in various manners. Personally I found it useful, since it''s been a while since I last used Pythonand have never used numpy or matplotlib.'	Overall, I would have liked to have more in-depth explanation as to why we had the kind of Python/R exercises we had.Also, I found it difficult to grasp the concept of hypothesis space just by reading the provided course book. It feels the course book assumes the readeris a mathematician, which makes it sometimes difficult to follow the concepts and calculations. Yes, a certain level of mathematical skills are required,but trivially leaving explanatory parts does not help learning.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Loss functions, I found them interesting.	The last exercise was time consuming for me at least, I did not get the correct answers for the quizz.	4 : 10-20 hours
I enjoyed the plotting exercises. It gives nice feeling of success when you actually see that you did something right.	Hypothesis space was the hardest concept to understand.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Getting the hands on experience introduction to tools used in course exercises.	No clear worst part.	2 : 1-5 hours
First coding assignment plotting was very good starting for the subject.	When we calculate eigenvectors and values because I am not sure how they fit on context?	3 : 6-10 Hours
The examples were clear to follow and nicely backed up by maths	Formatting of the notes w/ labels showing	2 : 1-5 hours
Generally getting a feel for handling data and seeing it translate into something meaningful in graphs.	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
Python exercises were absolutely best. (I love coding) :)	'Can''t really point a single thing that was the worst.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
All the topics are good. In a sense, they teach plotting, matrix operatings and vector operations, which are also available in MATLAB. In basic Python courses, such topics are usually skipped.	The worst part is the fact the right answers you gave in hte previous quiz attempt are not stored and you have to tick them again.	2 : 1-5 hours
the basics are quite clear	Hopothesis space could have been explained more clearly	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 3: Nice to get recap of eigenvectors. Good visualisations to really understand what eigenvectors are all about.&nbsp;	'Task 1: Boring and I don''t see how it fits in to the context of the course yet.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked jypyter excercises as they give a hands on feel to ML.	At the same time some jypyter tasks were just about using right library functions to calculate something. This felt more like pyplot, numpy and pandas excercise rather than ML excercise.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Numpy and matplotlib basics were well introduced and it was good to show how to use matrices in that environment.	All the math were not yet connected to practicality so it was quite vague how they are going to be used.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 2 was the most interesting regarding data point handling. Further, the lectures were very clear and good.	Task 1 felt unnecessary for the rest of the round.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Feedback on quiz.	'Jypyter, because it''s a completely new thing to me. More detailed instructions would be helpful at least in the first round.'	4 : 10-20 hours
learning do to matlab stuff with numpy&nbsp;was pretty cool, also that it was taught and demonstrated properly was a good thing.	the quiz referred to the textbook which i dont&nbsp;even know what it is called and couldnt&nbsp;access to it. Probably wont get it from now on so those questions felt awkward.	4 : 10-20 hours
'I like the Jupyter workspace - first time using it. It''s really easy to use and seems to do what it should quite flawlessly. An excellent way of hosting assignments which require programming!'	I think the course book is a bit of a tough read. The text feels repetitive and the heavy use of parenthesis (even nested (like this)!) kinda breaks the flow.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Learning terms well and how the ML problems are formed on big pictureClarified the complexity of machine learning quite a bit.	Matrix invertibility check with multiple choiceI did not really find a link to learn why the quiz answer was correct: neither in book or the exercises.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
I think all the python notebook exercises were very good.	'Theoretical matrix theory question. There wasn''t much explanations how to answer quiz.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Features and labels since they were the most essential concepts	The math as I had forgotten most of it	3 : 6-10 Hours
I did enjoy getting familiar with numpy.	'I''ve somewhat forgotten the basics of linear algebra and matrices, so I had/have to do some recap on those.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
explanation of the relationship between AI and ML is very clear and concise	eigenvectors and eigenvalues, still hard to wrap my head around it.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Materials and tasks in jupyter were nice. They were well structured. It helps when I can test and see things in practice. 	I did not get anything out of the lectures.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 2 of python exercises. Simple enough to do, clear instructions. Nice pictures.	Task 3. Really confusing task, there should have been more theory/examples about this. Not so easy to understand.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The whole defining of the basic machine learning problem was very interesting. Simply because I''ve been into data crunching with traditional methods for a while and this is a whole new area for me.Also, plotting the figures with Python was a nice excercise for first round.'	'Well, linear algebra''s never been my strongest suit, so I had to scratch my head once or twice while completing those. I know it''s an important and essential, even an integral part of all this, nevertheless.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 2 of the Python notebook. It served as a good Python refresher when I needed one.	The theory questions in the quiz were a bit ambiguous. I thought I understood the concepts fairly well, but it took some brute force guessing to find the correct answers.	2 : 1-5 hours
The Python progamming exercises gave a great recap of basic Python and a good introduction to the math and plotting libraries.	Algebra, due to it being many years ago since I took the mathematics courses.	4 : 10-20 hours
'Plotting the data from files. I don''t know.. I just like working with data and visualizing it.'	Nothing really annoyed me yet. 	3 : 6-10 Hours
Actually writing lines of code. Also, that the quiz worked as a validator of sorts: the assignment text itself was poorly arranged so that I missed many things from the assignment before I faced them in the quiz.	'Mathematics. I''m not fond of highly theoretical mathematics, and thus the university-style of depicting the basic rules of matrixes behind ML were near impossible for me to comprehend. But I fault that to myself, not the course: we''re in a university of technology, after all.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Writing and running the notebooks. It feels hands on and verification is fast.	'Reading the book. Not that it''s not well written, but it''s always annoying to read technical stuff with a "general interest" mindset instead of something to solve a problem. Just my preference.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 3 of coding assignment. Good intro to using linear algebra with python.	'The second question in the quiz (matrix invertibility). I didn''t find this covered in any part of the course book/exercises.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'Don''t know'	Hypothesis space was explained possibly too complicated.	2 : 1-5 hours
Labels states for what are we using the ML for. 	Hypothesis Space is harder to understand compared to other topics.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The last python notebook exercise. I haven''t done anything related to matrices in a while, and that exercise forced me to refresh my memory on the topic.'	'Don''t really have anything negative to say about the first round.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
A real-world example of human activity (Bitcoin and Ethereum prices) was interesting and easy to understand. The example of different Python functions as part of a hypothesis space in Figure 17 is good, because it concretizes the quite abstract concept of hypothesis space. 	Actually, I cannot think of any; the tutorial is compact but understandable. During the task 3 (eigenvectors) I spent some time (one hour?) reading the matplotlib manual in the Jupyter notebook to find out how to draw the eigenvectors in the picture. However, I consider that is just part of learning matplotlib.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I enjoyed doing the graphs. Pictures tell 1000 times more information than raw data.&nbsp;	Basic calculation are not so interesting.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Hypothesis space: It is a set of function which used to map the feature space to the labels. Given that there are infinitely many mapping functions in a given hypothesis&nbsp;space, choosing&nbsp;the best predictor function out of all the hypothesis&nbsp;space is one interesting&nbsp;part of machine learning.	'I don''t have a comment on this.&nbsp;'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Programming exercises. Gives better understanding of the topics discussed in course book because one really haves to understand the theory to do the tasks.	Quiz. The quiz was a bit too easy.	4 : 10-20 hours
'Overall it was ok. Good visual examples with proper dataset to make the concept of data spread clear. However, at first it wasn''t clear how the scatter data has to be plotted (x is the first column and y the second one).'	The one regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I read separately on the below link to better understand ithttp://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/geometric-interpretation-covariance-matrix/	3 : 6-10 Hours
The example of Roomba is helpful. The Jupyter note exercises are great.	The text book is good but sometimes it gets to fast into details/concepts. It lacks a diagram showing the ML workflow from data-&gt;features-&gt;labels-&gt;... indicating the different methods that can be applied in each transition.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The whole coding assignment was nice! It was pretty well done. It reminded me Andrew Ng''s course which I took from Coursera (Deep Learning). Although I couldn''t finish it, haha.'	-0	4 : 10-20 hours
I liked the Task 2 of the coding assignments: I found and tried different ways to get the final result and I think this taught me to not only go with the first idea that works.	'I didn''t like the quiz that much; the questions about matrix properties that weren''t even included in the task scared me at first, because I haven''t worked with matrices for a while. It was good to check those things out, but it was a nasty surprise that it popped out in the quiz.'	4 : 10-20 hours
I think that task 3 might be the best part of this ground. It is fun to play with tools like numpy, matplotlib and pandas.	Nothing really bothered me so I think that there was nothing really bad. Round 1 was nice introduction to concepts of ML.	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked how the problem was generalized to 4 key components to which most (all?) data inference problems can be mapped to.	Nothing	3 : 6-10 Hours
Real life applications of ML	The hypothesis space remained somewhat unclear to me.	3 : 6-10 Hours
This was the introduction&nbsp;to the topic- Therefore, the whole round was rather useful. The idea of visualizing the data could have been the best part.	The idea behind eigenvectors and -values could have been explained more comprehensively.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
Data analysis exercise 2. Simple and easy to understand directions.	'Finding typos in the text. Do we get points for this or what is this? Are there intentional mistakes in the text or is the teacher using us to proofread his text? Because I''d rather spend my time learning about the topic than searching for typos. There must be better ways to make sure we read the text if that''s what you''re trying to do.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
All the jupyter notebook tasks were nice reminders and warmup for further python excercises	the very particlar matrix questions came as a surprise and were challenging since it has been a while since playing with them more.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Plotting. It is always useful to visualize results.	Notebook could have been longer	2 : 1-5 hours
The practical programming assignments were a nice introduction to libraries related to machine learning.	'There wasn''t really anything that stood out in a bad way.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Eigenvector exercise was the best part of this round, because eigenvectors are difficult to understand but the exercise was well explained.&nbsp;	First two exercises were too easy.	2 : 1-5 hours
The scatter figure!	It was all okay.	2 : 1-5 hours
The last exercise was the best one. It was well explained.	Loss function	5 : more than 20 hours
Features and labels were the best part of this round. They helped me in understanding machine learning problems. It was really interesting to learn point of view of machine learning in problem solving.	The part that news improvements is&nbsp;Hypothesis Space. I think it could be explained in a better way with examples. The examples in online teaching sites helped me to understand this topic. Reading material can also be improved.	5 : more than 20 hours
I think the first lecture was excellent. From the lecture, I think the simplicity of the explanation of ML was the best thing about the lecture. I think even people with low level mathematical understanding could follow.&nbsp;	I think the quiz was only mediocre, since it was hard to tell how quickly I should rush through the questions, &nbsp;especially since the second question (at least in my quiz) was about matrix algebra, which could not be done without practice or studying. I spent a long time trying to make sure my answers would be correct, but I was still rushing since I thought other questions would be similarly difficult and time consuming.	2 : 1-5 hours
I think the coding Task 2 is useful overall among all the tasks.	Loss function was a difficult topic to really grasp in contrast to, for me, much easier concepts (features, labels). Hypothesis space I understood somehow, maybe not completely yet.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 1 was good for either learning to use numpy or relearn it after a while. There were several different elements to do and the task was not too straightforward.	Task 2 got me some time to get it right. Also the system gave some warnings about using .as_matrix	3 : 6-10 Hours
Labels were explained in a very understandable way	Hypothesis space went a bit over my head and could have been explained more thoroughly	2 : 1-5 hours
I think the coding excercises were altogether very, niced, they helped a lot to understand the subject in matter	'I think the typo searching was my least favorite, didn''t really understand the point first'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the 2.1 section of the course book. It explained the concepts behind features and labels nicely and gave good real-world examples.	The programming exercise was pretty tame. It felt really easy. 	2 : 1-5 hours
I think features are the best part since they are closely tied to the engineer working on the problem and it gives the engineer some manual access to the problem domain.	Hypothesis space was explained a bit weirdly. It is also more theoretical in the machine learning domain in which approximations are built to model the world around us.	2 : 1-5 hours
All exercises, i.e. programming in Python. It was somewhat time consuming but a lot of fun to get back to using Python.&nbsp;	'It''s hard to pick a worst one, but one think I would love to have improved is Alex''s drawings.&nbsp;They are great, but draws a lot on the same sheet and signs over other signs, then puts some crosses, thus after the lecture you forget what was supposed to be correct and what referred to what.&nbsp;Also, It would be great if he could number his drawings or not put as many circles around things :D&nbsp;'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I really enjoyed the clear explanation of features and labels. It''s a core concept that everyone should have perfectly clear in their minds, and I really appreciate that the course was thorough with it despite needing to take a lot of time for it.'	'One of the topics that I think still wasn''t clear enough was the formation of weight functions for each hypothesis space predictor.It felt like there was a missed gap in the work pipeline that failed to explain how the weight functions vary for different predictor. Should we just test all possible combinations of vector indices and also, where do they really originate from/how do you put them together?'	4 : 10-20 hours
Exercise 2: I learned how to plot multiple datasets into one figure and how .show() actually creates a new plain figure for plotting the next plots.	Exercise 3: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues -&gt; what do they represent in the data set?&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Hypothesis space was relatively new to me and it was well described in the course book. 	Finding typos in the text, are you kidding me?	2 : 1-5 hours
The use of JupyterHub was a great thing as it helped me understand the theory in practice. Task 2 was useful.	'Task 3 Eigenvectors - I didn''t fully understand how that was related to this round. The course material didn''t contain any material to solve the task, and I found it very difficult even with help from the Web.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The section on loss functions (2.3). It was mathematically precise-enough but still concise, it had neat examples and it made it clear, why I should study the chapter well: I''m going to meet it again in future chapters.'	'Not so much a part of this round as a general comment: the lecture notes are good but written in a somewhat-too-prosaic style, which I''d exchange for a hardline, no-nonsense approach focusing on mathematical necessities (but no topology, please). Then again, in all honesty, I''ve only read the first two chapters, so this might just be because of the introductory purpose of the chapters.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Learning some basic Python. Basics of how ML works in practice.	'Handling matrix-arrays and vectors when one is not very fluent with those. But can''t be avoided, need to study more to improve. Also selecting parts of an array to plot in different colours took time, until understood the correct way of writing the code. E.g. plt.scatter(data[200:399,0],data[200:399,1],[20],''g'') took time to formulate since one could not find clear instructions anywhere how to plot only a part of a single column in an array, not the whole column.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Labels	Matrices	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the part where the eigenvalues were needed, as this gave me a brief revision to linear algebra.	The part where the data points needed to be separated into 3 different subsets. It felt a bit tedious, especially when there was almost 2 identical answers to the problem on the quiz.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The second exercise (Data.csv) was very useful as a way to get started with Python, as it involved all the basic steps of data loading, some preprocessing (slicing the dataset) and plotting.&nbsp;	Plotting the vectors in the last part of the third exercise was very difficult for me. I admit that my linear algebra knowledge was a bit rusty, however some googling and wikipedia reading helped to understand the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. A small recap or cheat sheet regarding the most important linear algebra concepts for ML would be useful. However, what was much harder than understand the theory was to get the bloody vectors plotted. By then, I knew exactly how they should look and could have drawn them on a piece of paper easily, but the Python implementation was time consuming.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
Tasks 2 and 3 in the programming exercises. These exercises reviewed some practicalities of data manipulation with python and helped my understanding of matrices.	Question 2 in the quiz. Although this question is important in terms of matrices, but the mathematical details in this question were beyond the course material for this exercise round.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The quiz. I am often stuck on these programming problems but at least this way I can know what the right answer is.&nbsp; So I know what to aim for and then can figure out the why it should be like that.	I am not familiar with python or JupyterHub but apparently there is no autofill feature? It is a big part of how I program and try to find a suitable function.	4 : 10-20 hours
Made me refresh on linear algebra and introduced numpy, both required for the cource	There was some use of deprecated code, as_matrix vs values	3 : 6-10 Hours
The basis of machine learning was explained clearly, the topics feature etc. were explained sufficiently extensively for a first timer.	the linear algebra was not reviewed extensively enough though the computerized excersises	3 : 6-10 Hours
The last computerize (4) exercise provided a good way to review some of the linear algebra concepts, eigenvalues etc.	The computerized exercises could have reviewed the python libraries more broadly. Maybe links to useful resources	3 : 6-10 Hours
Plotting the data in the exercises to visualise it better.	Nothing comes to my mind. I think especially the exercises will take a lot more time later.	4 : 10-20 hours
Learning Pandas &amp; Numpy libraries as knowledge in them can be beneficial in the future (outside the course as well)	Theory behind eigenvalues and eigenvectors as these were something I was not previously familiar with.	2 : 1-5 hours
Very good introduction, although the exercises could have been more challenging. I would say the best part of the round was the overall hands-on experience with Jupyter. None of the parts specifically stood out, since they were quite similar and all very short.	I would say the "worst" part was how easy the assignments were. I understand that this was the introduction, but it would have been nice with more exercises or a challenge part of some sort. The questions were good.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and plotting them. It was a concrete task and I learned some new Numpy functions.	The lecture slides have some questions (e.g. size of the hypothesis space). It would be cool to have the answers to these questions in some form even if do not attend the lectures.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Outlining of the basic pieces of machine learning and describing what ML is all about, was done well here in the beginning. Gave good foundation to build the rest of the knowledge pyramid.	0	4 : 10-20 hours
Book turned out to be great read. Good material is always worth it	Jupyterhub is a little laggy and really is not match to modern editors when learning new coding related stuff. 	2 : 1-5 hours
It is long since I coded python or worked with matrices, so I liked the very first task 0 task the best.	'I think it was not nice to try to find typos from the book. I think it doesn''t test really anything.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Eigenvectors, refreshing memory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.	Question 2 of the excercises was extremely frustrating to think about. Figuring the correct answer to that problem took more time than the rest of the whole exercise for some reason	3 : 6-10 Hours
This round was very good introduction to machine learning, especially the introduction chapter in the course book, since it explains the basics how machine learning works in principle.	All the exercises were good introduction in my opinion. For the worst part, I would choose that there was a small lack of information for me what types of questions the Quiz would contain (questions about the jupyter exercises and general questions). But now that I know the contents, it is no longer unclear.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The exercises were appropriate in difficulty and length, however picking a favorite is difficult.	Some of the specific functions that had to be used (for example plotting the eigenvectors) were difficult to find and in the future some more information could be given on how to approach a problem.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
'The task 2 in the coding exercise was the best part. The exercise was easy to understand. And anyway, it is nice that you give some ground to the python exercises that one doesn''t need to do everything from the very beginning (if one have only basics skills of Python). I learned a lot during the first round with the examples and base codings you had done. '	'The Quiz included a question related to an invertible matrix. I was quite lost in that part and the book or lecture didn''t say anything about it. '	4 : 10-20 hours
third	second	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The best part was applying the theory with the hands-on exercises (python coding assignment). Theory is on thing - it''s easy to pretend to yourself that you understand it - but applying the theory by doing the assignment really forces you to understand what you are doing. It would be nice, though, if there would be some checks implemented in the coding assignments to verify you are doing things correctly (I believe this is at least partially done in round 2 [and of course any questions would be answered in the exercise garages as well, although I am primarily doing this course remotely])And thanks, by the way, for the webcast - much appreciated as it saves me from going to Otaniemi for just this course.'	My understanding of matrix and vector theory is somewhat limited, so following the theory is sometimes not so easy	3 : 6-10 Hours
Course book chapter 2.Nice introduction to the subject, clear definitions of the parts of the ML problem.Also good examples.	The first 2 exercises were maybe too easy.	2 : 1-5 hours
Labels because I am dabbling with semisupervised learning in my thesis which also serves as the basis for my knowledge related to this topic and whatnot.	No complaints as of yet seeing as this is just the beginning	1 : less than 1 hour
The exercise with the gradient drawing, it applied the use of eigenvectors which was interesting.	The loss function because I think I did not quite get it.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Task 3 eigenvectors - the math is important, it''s what I want to learn more.'	Task 1, because it was so easy. On the other hand, it is good that people that are not familiar with Python can start off with something that is not so difficult.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the coding exercise a lot. It was practical and very motivating. I liked the guidance.	'Well nothing was bad. Of course my mood was the worst when I didn''t know the answers to matrix theory related questions. I realized that I need to study that more.'	4 : 10-20 hours
The exercises were nice and taught numpy and matplotlib nicely.	'In the quiz, I was not quite sure where I should''ve found out the answers to the first few questions about the matrices.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Task 2: Introduction to Pandas was clear and helpful for someone such as me who hasn''t used it before. Interesting analytical possibilities. In addition, definition of ML problems was really well explained during the lectures'	The eigen vector exercise (task 3) was a bit unclear and it was relatively difficult to find adequate help online and from the materials. Probably it will become clearer with sufficient trainint. Now it was partly my own schedule that made understanding difficult. 	4 : 10-20 hours
'I think all the topics were explained extremely well with excellent examples and all these topics are crucial in understanding machine learning, there''s no worst or best.'	'I think all the topics were explained extremely well with excellent examples and all these topics are crucial in understanding machine learning, there''s no worst or best.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I especially liked the last task of the programming exercises. It was a welcome reminder of the connection between the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix and the principal components of the data matrix.	I disliked the fact that I had to browse through the documentations of multiple different python libraries. I understand that it is a necessary step to learn the tools used on this course but I do a lot of that already and sometimes it gets a bit boring to learn new (but very similar) tools again and again. Perhaps some kind of cheat sheet with the necessary information could be provided on the mycourses page?	2 : 1-5 hours
The quiz	Loss function	4 : 10-20 hours
The programming exercises in general were the best part. The round was a great way to learn basic Python functions and the exercises were organised well.	The "typo" questions in the quiz were unnecessary. If you want someone to check the book for mistakes, I would find new place to do this. Having such questions in a quiz which is evaluated was confusing.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Honestly, plotting with pyplot and pandas. I''ve done this very little, but still a skill many employers require. Good to get some exercise on that.As for the material, the concept of hypothesis space intrigued me. I suppose we will spend some time working on different types of predictors and classifiers, which is also useful for common mathematical knowhow.'	Nothing really. The quiz was ok too (except that I got tricked into picking only one eigenvector matrix when there are in fact three with some prefactor, so I had to sift through all other questions again). 	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the lecture containing the concrete example of the "apple app". It helped in understanding the concepts introduced in the course so far.	Having quiz questions related to the programming assignments does not seem to serve any purpose. It think it would be better to have the programming assignments just graded with test automation/some TA work (as in almost all other courses having programming assignments) and have the quizzes containing only questions related to theory regarding the subject.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked how I learned to draw functions and derivates with pyplot in the exercises.	The vector drawing. There was no practice with drawing them so it took a long time to get them.	2 : 1-5 hours
All the exercises were pretty good warmup for the course. The basic things learnt were not so new to me so hard to evaluate which was the best part, but I like learning in practice, so the exercises were the best so far.	The matrix mathematics in the questionnaires. Required work to be done outside the course materials, but not so big of a problem. 	4 : 10-20 hours
'The Python notebook worked well and gives detailed instructions. It''s nice not to have to download any dependencies or files.'	'The online quiz layout is terrible. The radio buttons for the images do not correspond to image (at least to me). For instance, the radio button (a,b,c,d) appears after the image, so for several questions I chose the wrong button! The images could be lined up next to each other with the correct radio button below each.Furthermore the instructions are not very clear in some cases, or they are in a location where it''s not easy to read. Question 13 and Question 15 seemed strange too.The instructions for the re-attempts are not clear; to me, it meant that once I submit there are two more opportunities to submit again.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Coding part was the best. It is nice when we can practically use those tools that we have learned at lectures.	Questions that have multiple choise answers and where the answers have just small nuance differences. They are just insignificant trifles and do not give much learning experience.	2 : 1-5 hours
Hypothesis space. This might be a biased estimate because I find that concept exciting - looking forward to learning more about what are factors that actually define the hypothesis space that can be reached (perhaps&nbsp; selection of loss function, optimization algorithm and more).	Features. Somehow I felt at times a bit lost in the discussion on features. I think I got it in the end (and because of previous experience) but felt the examples presented in the material were a bit hard to understand. Perhaps because I felt some of them were completely synthetic, ie. not something one would do in real life.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Overall as an introduction round, it was great to include already the basic functionalities, as plotting and reading from a file, neither of which was covered in basic Python course	'First exercise included derivation, and for me it wasn''t clear whether or not it is meant to be done via some python library, or to derivate by hand. It took me quite a long time to try out different possible functionalities. Guess that derivation wasn''t in the main focus of the exercise.'	4 : 10-20 hours
The Features and labels were explained very in detail and with many examples which helped to understand the consepts.	I found hard to grasp the idea of Loss function choosing on more of why this particular function is better than the other and what differences they would have if implemented on the same ML problem.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The coding exercises where fun because you yourself can get some concrete examples of how things work.	'The exercises where we where supposed to find typos wasn''t that great, it takes your focus away from reading and understanding the material to simply trying to find typos.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The idea that ML is essentially iteratively choosing&nbsp; an optimal hypothesis from a theoretically huge hypothesis space. This embodies " learning " so well.	I could not understand why the exponential function in "plotting" exercise of the coding assignment was already done. Also it is not clear what the question within limits [-6,6] means	3 : 6-10 Hours
Exercise 7. was interesting to code.	Typo reporting exercises.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I think that the topics were laid out in the course book very well. One specific matter that I enjoyed reading about was in 2.2, about how the size choice for hypothesis space H affects the success of the overall design of the ML problem. I.e., even selecting an H that maps every 512x512 pixels'' BW-values to a binary label (towards/away) would yield an unreal number of hypotheses. Something to really think about.To me, the most important quality of a book (or course book) is that it gets you excited about the subject, and I think that this one definitely does it.'	'I was maybe expecting for the first notebook to share a bit more of the great context laid out in the course book''s chapters 1-2. However, I do see the point of giving introductions to doing some basic matrix operations in python, as the notebook did.'	4 : 10-20 hours
The programming assingment, although I think it was a bit too easy even for a first round assignment.&nbsp;	The quiz questions regarding the programming assignment seemed totally useless to me, since we already answer them in the assignment itself??	2 : 1-5 hours
-0	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 3. I learned how to use of the numpy tools, which I found helpful. I imagine that numpy will be useful in the near future	Question number 2. I could not really find the answer to this question from the course material. Had to search the web to find the answer.	3 : 6-10 Hours
It was good that the exercises taught basic numpy and matplotlib. They will certainly be useful later.	The quiz was a bit frustrating as in re-attempts you had to re-select the answers that already went correct. Also. the question about eigenvectors obtained in the programming exercise was a bit of a trick question.	2 : 1-5 hours
The concept of hypothesis spaces was an excellent introduction: I believe it will work as a platform to connect the upcoming concepts as ways to traverse it in most efficient way for each problem.	I was going to write about the ambiguity of the label&nbsp;question in the quiz but decided the difference is far too pedantic and philosophical. I might come talk about it after some lecture. Overall, the course seems exquisitely organized.	2 : 1-5 hours
I like the fact that there was an extended explanation about the importance of machine learning, as it makes pupils more motivated.	The excercises has little to no example code, which makes learning to use the packages a little bit hard,	2 : 1-5 hours
'python notebook is a good idea, though I don''t understand what the ''submit'' button represents.'	None.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The course material had a good and comprehensive explanation of hypothesis space which helped to understand what is meant by it and what is it used for. This I was most confused about after the first lecture but understood it after reading.	'Worst was perhaps the coding assignments. I was already familiar with numpy and matplotlib so there wasn''t much to learn from those simplest assignments.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Explanation of the required terms was good.	Explaining Loss function and Hypothesis Space was a bit confusing. For example, I think taking derivative of the cost function is far from being a simple&nbsp;thing (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/70728/partial-derivative-in-gradient-descent-for-two-variables). So instead of just saying that this is prerequisite,&nbsp;I would maybe devote some time on explaining how it is actually done.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
Description of ML problem (in lecture slides), describes what machine learning is in a nice short, yet accurate way	Quizz of exercises feels a bit stupid as it means kind of double work to fill in your answers. Obviously a better way would be an automated checking on jupyterhub notebook but I understand it would require a lot of work from course staff	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 3 - Eigenvectors. The task elaborated in practise how the eigenvectors function	Task 2 as it took me a lot of time to figure out the syntax needed to complete the task	4 : 10-20 hours
Best&nbsp; part was loss functions. They were most interesting.&nbsp;	'Background questions, i.e. the second question was not taught in lecture or book. I still don''t get it.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Coding exercises, especially the third one. It was a good refresher on Python and Numpy after a bit of a break over the summer.	'This is a really minor thing, but I''m personally not a huge fan of coding exercises with prewritten code. Obviously not a huge factor here with so little code, but with longer assignments I feel it''s better to start from scratch so the code is uniform and I have the freedom to code each part as I like.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Programming task 2 was a good reminder on how to use numpy / python.	Hard to pick worst part yet since this really felt like a warmup round. If I have to pick maybe reading the course book can be a bit tedious. 	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I generally found the whole concept of machine learning interesting. It''s a departure from the traditional way of programming.'	'Can''t think of any.'	2 : 1-5 hours
All the exercises were good. They were easy to understand and implement. I particularly liked the exercise on eigenvectors and eigenvalues as they helped recall some of the main concepts of linear algebra. 	I did not find any particular exercise to be the worst.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Best part was Exercise 3. It was a good refresher on matrix algebra (not necessarily my strongest area) and also nicely illustrated the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.	'I don''t think there was any worst part in the exercise. What was a bit annoying that in the quiz there were questions about matrix algebra which required some further looking into. This didn''t have an effect on my score and it was also announced that people should brush up their matrix algebra. Still, it would have been nice to know that there will be matrix algebra related questions in the quiz.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
This was a good introduction round to get the course started. Also I know the applications of the machine learning better now.	'There wasn''t any bad things in this round but I didn''t quite understand that are the coding exercises provided going to be graded or are they just exercises to practise and the quiz is the only thing to be graded? Since there was questions about the coding exercises int he quiz so I was just wondering...'	3 : 6-10 Hours
programming is always nice, although there was a bit of interpretations in the directions (which variable to which axis in plot etc)	It was just basics, so nothing too bad. Maybe there is something worse next round? :)	4 : 10-20 hours
The assignment in which we were required to plot the eigenvectors. I think visual explanations of mathematic concepts are always helpful in understanding them. Maybe some explanation regarding the direction and magnitude of the eigenvectors might have also been useful.	Maybe the fact that you are still using numpy.matrix even though it is deprecated in the documentation ;)	3 : 6-10 Hours
The plotting of the datasets and eigenvalues was a good recap. I learn how to compute the eigenvalues in python.	The plotting of the eigenvalue vectors. The documentation for plotting of vectors on top of a graph was really bad and it was hard to find good examples and understand how it works.	4 : 10-20 hours
It was good to see how pandas works, because I have not used it earlier. It was nice to go trough eigenvectors and values as well.	Did not find anything bad about the exercises. Basic good information.	2 : 1-5 hours
Practical examples in the course book	The coding assignment	2 : 1-5 hours
In the lectures, very good explanations for the hypothesis space and the loss function were given. I have taken one online ML course before but these aspects remained a bit blurry for me.	'None. Sorry, couldn''t think of any.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'missed this particular exercise, can''t really say.'	'missed this particular exercise, can''t really say.'	1 : less than 1 hour
The part that made me thing was questions about invertible positivie semidefinite matrix and question about size of the hypothesis.Questions about eigen vectors was also tricky. I forgot that you can scale eigen vectors ans they still remain eigen vectors	In exercises were one had to select correct plot ir was easy to select wrong plot by mistake becouse how tcks are positioned. Appart from that are exercises seemed appropriate. 	3 : 6-10 Hours
Exercises 2 and 3 were good and gave a good insight to the python "toolbox", the book was nice for explaining labels.	'Task 1 was maybe the most unnecessary part of this round but it''s still useful for learning. Worst part was maybe to have to google all the ready functions in Python'	4 : 10-20 hours
JupyterHub was really easy and convenient to use, also the exercises gave a good and fun introduction to the needed tools.	The linear algebra trivia questions, looking up random facts is always tedious.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The Jupyter exercises as a whole were good. I look forward to more of them.	No bad parts.	2 : 1-5 hours
I thought the whole round was quite interesting. The most interesting part would have to be the featurespace/hypothesisspace/loss functions, because they demand the most thought process from the developer.	'Can''t say which is the worst part, but the least interesting part would be the linear algebra, even though it is a necessary part of machine learning, because it''s just raw math before it is given context in which to use i.e. math without a real-life function.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked all the topics in this round.	worst part of the round was the question 2 in the quiz. i have completed the matrix course but still i was not able to answer the question	3 : 6-10 Hours
Lectures on web!Clear book and manageable amount to read and understand the content per week.Clear step by step style of the&nbsp;programming assignments - almost started to like math&amp;python.	One hour time limit of questionaire and impossibility to do them side by side with reading/programming.&nbsp; Briefly: just hated this form.	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 2. Files. The instructions were very clear.	Task 3. Eigenvectors. The instructions could have been maybe a bit better.	4 : 10-20 hours
I liked to learn about the basic principles of machine learning (features, labels etc.) because I had no previous experiment with machine learning. 	'I didn''t like the first exercise in jupyterhub. It had nothing to do with the exercise exactly but it was hard to get the hang of numpy etc (I have used Python before but I have not used this kinds of packages etc.) After finishing the exercises, they seem a bit more familiar.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'Task 3 was perhaps the best, or at least for me the most learning exercise. This is because linear algebra is not my strongest area, it''s always good to remind myself of these things. This is also the first time that I have seen the eigenvectors drawn on top of a figure, and they made much more sense this way! '	Perhaps the hypothesis space and that question on the quiz. In the book it says that hypothesis space is normally a small subset of all possible ways. How answer correctly to how large of the hypothesis space is, if the size depends on what subset you choose?	4 : 10-20 hours
'I like that you don''t need to return the code, but it was tested with the pictures that did I even do the coding.'	'The time limit. It stressed me. The round would be as pedagogical without the time limit. Even better I think, ''cause you could pause and think something for even over the night. Now you have to stress of the time limit (though as it turned out, I stressed for nothing). But I will stress it again. It''s not nice.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The eigenvector decomposition was cool and illustrative	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked all the exercises, they were nice smooth start.	In a way the course started from too basic things.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Matrix questions, because I was in need of training.	There was no real worst part on this round. I found everything from the course material, lectures and questions to be good quality.	4 : 10-20 hours
Phyton notebooks, such an easy way to get started.	Well some descriptions in the python exercises were a bit two-sided, and required some interpretation.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
The loss function and empirical risk chapter was the best part	The first exercise was no exercise at all	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the exercise number 3 the most. It helped me recall the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Additionally, the produced scatter plot in exercise 3 illustrated the eigenvectors very well. The exercise had a good sum up about the basic functions of numpy and pyplot.	The worst part was maybe Task 1. There could have been a short list of useful functions of pyplot as a hint to students. This was a minor minus, though, because it was easy to find the right functions to use.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The combination of the exercises and the quiz was really smart. The difficulty level of the exercises was in the correct range.&nbsp;	The introduction of feature vectors was not sufficient. I am having a hard time understanding the concept.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I considered the plotting of the derived function the best part, due to it showcasing functions for Python, and how the syntax in general works for it	Plotting vectors, due to the methods of Python for this being quite poor&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
I Liked the jupyter excercises, especially using the plot function	I Disliked reading the course book, I have always disliked theoretical function examples.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The first plotting exercise provided a simple and useful introduction to using the numPy and matplotlib.pyplot packages in computing and plotting data.	The eigenvector task seemed to be a bit hard to approach due to being quite math heavy for an introductory round, particularly computing the covariance matrix.	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the coding assignment because i could get familiar with python (no prior knowledge) 	Nothing really	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Lecture recordings, because I don''t have to be at certain time at school to attend the lecture and I can revisit the topics of the lecture that weren''t so clear at the first time.'	'Math isn''t my strongest feature, so maybe those parts.&nbsp;'	2 : 1-5 hours
The second exercise of round 1 is best part. It demands of me to refresh my skills in python and learn how to use jupyter notebook. Also, it was fun to draw different segments of the data in different colors.	'Honestly, the worst part of the round is the necessity to use jupyter notebook. I like to do homework on school computers, and I must find a computer that has jupyter notebook installed. Therefore, it requires of me to move to a place where I usually don''t do homework.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I love coding!	I dunno	2 : 1-5 hours
Examples that were used were good (in the course book) and helped to get understanding of the fairly abstract concepts such as feature and hypothesis spaces.	I did not find the python notebook useful: topics were elementary and probably familiar for large portion of the students	2 : 1-5 hours
Calculating and visualizing eigenvalues. It shows clearly that the main component of the data can be interpreted from those.	Finding typos from the book. It left me wondering how is it graded and if it does not affect the grade, it would be nice to say.	3 : 6-10 Hours
No comment, because I am already familiar with the very basics.	'Randomizing the order of selections in the quiz makes it difficult to fix any mistakes in a previous submission, and easily causes new carelesness mistakes while doing so. On the other hand, mere order randomization doesn''t prevent cheating. Therefore I would appreciate it, if randomization would be disabled, or better yet, it would be possible to edit previous answers.Having to switch between MyCourses, JupyterHub, and the course book feels inconvenient. In my opinion it would be nicer for the student if the course book was hosted in a learning management system like A+, which allows having quizzes and programming exercises mixed within the material.Many questions in the quiz felt like I could just as well have answered them by reasoning about what the answer must look like. This makes me feel like my work was slightly in vain.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Shazam example on lecture "How to Specify A Machine Learning Problem?". Real life example that is still simple and really useful.	Had some troubles and hiccups with using online jupyter and would have been nice to have guide how to run it locally. 	4 : 10-20 hours
I think the task 2 was the best one since it taught basic python skills and also some useful syntax and skills.	The first questions of the quiz where somewhat strange and I did not understand how those relate to what we have done during this week.	2 : 1-5 hours
in python notebook, Plotting the eigenvectors of a cov matrix on scatterplot. It gives such a good example on what eigevectors are. This i math basics, but important.	in python notebook, Getting scatterplots of different data frames in same plot with different colors. Took longer thatn it should.It is confusing to use both matplotlib and pandas, albeit pandas uses matplotlib. Getting used to figures takes time.	2 : 1-5 hours
Plotting was quite nice, as you get to visualise the given data and manipulate the said data further on and see how the actions you take affect the data.	I hopped into the course quite late and missed the first lectures and so I was a bit rushed to go through all the exercises and reading through the material.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The&nbsp;Bitcoin and Ethereum example was nice since it gave a concrete example, using the terms that were taught to us during this round.	Sometimes I got confused about the hypothesis space definitions in the course book.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The programming assignment 3 (Eigenvectors), as doing it taught me the most about working with numpy and matplotlib, and made me revise some linear algebra concepts.	In the quiz the questions about typos found in the book should perhaps be moved to this feedback form. It is easier to answer such questions without a time limit (although one hour was quite generous), and I was unsure if I should post the same comment again when re-taking the quiz to fix some dumb mistakes. Not a big deal, just a tiny annoyance. :)	3 : 6-10 Hours
The label-topic was interesting and was represented relatively clearly.	Hypothesis space is still a bit unclear, but I guess it will be described more precisely later on.	4 : 10-20 hours
I liked the exercises. They&nbsp;effectively taught how to use numpy and matplotlib and I think that this information will be helpful in the future.	I disliked the time limit on the quiz. Especially because you can try the quiz three times it seems really pointless.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 2. It seemed most useful.	'The last task. I didn''t get it right,.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Hypothesis space was clearly defined.	Loss functions were defined well, but at some points, such as with gradient descent, from slides is not clear if f is loss function or the hypothesis. More definitions visible, please!	2 : 1-5 hours
'Task 3, eigenvectors. I''ve learned about them in math courses, but never really understood what they are - having them visualised on the plotted data really helped me understand what they describe.&nbsp;'	'Task 3, eigenvectors - it was the best exercise, but also the worst. There''s a matrix that needs to be transposed, it took a long time to figure that out.&nbsp;'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The idea that with machine learning, we are attempting to find a good estimate for a function that describes the mapping between the input and the output. It made things (that I have previously struggled to understand) click for me.	'The invertibility question amongst the first questions in the quiz really surprised me. Maybe I missed some connection between it and the things that were explained, but I could not figure it out, nor did I even know that I should''ve prepared for it.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I enjoy the Jupyter Notebook format of the exercises.	The quiz. Doing it was mostly just switching between my Jupyter Notebook and the quiz tab. I get that it makes your job easier, but it still felt lazy to me.	2 : 1-5 hours
The questions related to basic linear algebra/matrix operations. The questions were clear and simple, but challenging enough so that I had to recap a few basic concepts.	-0	2 : 1-5 hours
Formulating a machine learning problem, because it helps to express something complex in mathematical terms and make predictions.	I do not have sufficient background in mathematics. Therefore, some concepts seem challenging to understand.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I understood the ideas behind each concept very well, especially with some prerequisites in Statistics. Maybe if the explanations behind the math were a bit more intuitive for people with weak mathematical background.&nbsp;	eigenvectors. Maybe a brief description of what it is used for in the course might help	5 : more than 20 hours
Calculating eigen values and vectors with python, because this was the first challenging/new assignment for me this week	the quizz questions with matrices and multiple choice answers, they always confuse me	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked much the Python exercises. They were not too hard and the exercises gave recap of fundamental statistical and programming skills.	Some parts in the quiz. For example, question 11 was misleading "Which one of the following matrices *contains* eigenvectors –– in its columns?". But overall, I found the quiz very educational and useful. Much more efficient than traditional pen and paper exercises/exams.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I like plotting the most, as I can see clearly my results and how the data behaves. Also, it helps remeber how to create a function.I dislkie the eignevecto	I dislike the eigenvector part the most because it is not as clear as I thought it should be (as in how it will relates to creating a mchine learning model)	4 : 10-20 hours
Aihe on kiinnostava	Matriisilaskennan suuri määrä	3 : 6-10 Hours
For me, the best part was understanding how to formulate ML problems mathematically in general. It was rewarding to see how ML works, although only on a high level of description.	I think it was not so clear how all of the linear algebra relates to machine learning. The relation could be explained more.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Features and label were explained in a easy to understand manner	The lecture notes were kind of messy, some text was hard to read. Watching them with the lecture video helped but still.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 3	-0	2 : 1-5 hours
The Quiz, as it forced really to think bout the topics.	Some of the questions about the properties of matrices, a little heads up would have been necessary and maybe a link to some material where to find the proper answers.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Task 3. Here we start to get real hands on, but it''s very good to also cover the basics first and not just dive straight in assuming we know this that and the other ...like many other courses do.'	'Typo quizzes. Maybe it was announced somewhere to expect these, maybe not? Not likely you remember anything if you are not prepared. And even if you are... in a time limited quiz setting this will get the lowest priority, as it doesn''t render any points, which is fine.I spotted some typos in "the first week", but can''t even remember in what courses they were. Now I have seen a couple in the text book material for round 2.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 2 of the python notebook. It provided a nice reminder that data is not always grouped into one neat correlation.	'Task 1 of the python notebook. It wasn''t bad, but out of all the exercises it was the least good, since it didn''t really seem to provide anything useful.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Loss functions were explained very clearly and comprehensively! Previously, I thought that they are always based on the empirical missclassification error (classification tasks), but the other functions fleshed out how loss functions work pretty well.	'1. I would have needed a short reminder about matrix calculus before jumping into the exercises as the text book didn''t talk about them to the extent that the exercises required. After studying them myself now, I think I will do fine, though.&nbsp;2. The picture quizzes. I am not sure, if you can do anything about it, but sometimes the checkbox referred to the answer on top of the checkbox and sometimes to below the checkbox. It was a bit annoying to always double check to what picture the checkbox referred to.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The examples from industry. It gave some context to the theory to start off the course.	'Numpy is rather awkward to work with. It is hard to understand its logic to such an extent that you don''t need to google up every single operation you want to do.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I liked the last part of the python exercise, since it was a practical application/refresher of linear algebra that I''d forgotten most of after the freshman year.'	'I hoped we''d get to linear regressions already, so the contents of the exercise round was a bit of a letdown.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The python exercises, practical work is an effective learning method for me.	Math related questions, probably just personal preference since	2 : 1-5 hours
The best part was plotting. Such simple first task was nice.	'Closing time 5.59pm. There is anyway a lot of work from other courses too so why won''t just let quiz be open until Sunday.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I thought that the explanation of the structure of a machine learning problem was fantastic. The course book had a clear structure explaining it and also offered a good example.	No major flaws. In the jupyter notebooks the instructions for the task are a little bit different on exercise description and on the comments in the code.	2 : 1-5 hours
Jupyter notebooks and coding	'Math, but that''s just that it is hard'	4 : 10-20 hours
In this round, the most useful exercise was Task 2. It was a good exercise to practice handling numpy&nbsp;arrays.	Task 1: Plotting was the worst part. It was difficult to find means to compute the derivative with numpy.	2 : 1-5 hours
'I''ve heard about logistic regression a lot in the past year so it was fun that I finally am in a course where it''s taught!'	'No topics really, maybe that I didn''t click all the right answers in the quz.'	2 : 1-5 hours
i liked python notebooks	finding typos	2 : 1-5 hours
Hands on exercises with the data and functions.	Lot of misconfusion with the variables in the exercise (e.g. changing between y&lt;-&gt;Y).	4 : 10-20 hours
The exercise 1was very straightforward to implement, and it also paved way for doing the other two exercises as well.	'Normalisation/scaling (page 12 on the course book ''Machine Learning: Basic Principles''), I had an issue in understanding what the equation (1) stands for literally.'	4 : 10-20 hours
I think task 3 is the best part because it was helpful learning how to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the exercises in the following rounds.	There is not really any worst part. The simplest one which could possibly be removed is the task 2.	1 : less than 1 hour
-0	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
Reading the course book. It is well written.	I did not enjoy online JupyterHub. I ended to use local Jupyter notebook.	4 : 10-20 hours
Examples using Rumba the robot were clear and very understandable.	The explanation of hypothesis space and why it has to be represented as a space in the first space.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The example showing cryptocurrencies was the best part for me. This example showed a practical approach to design a feature and a label and gave a hint of how to deal with these data afterwards.	'The term hypothesis ''space'' was hard to accept and understand for me. Why is it called ''space'' instead of ''algorithm'' or ''logic'' or else?'	4 : 10-20 hours
'It''s nice to get some practice with matrices since I''m not that great at them.'	'I don''t have any complaints.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The last coding assignment was a good reminder to me, what eigenvectors are.	Nothing to me about this round stands out as bad.	2 : 1-5 hours
Python exercises were nice! I enjoyed doing them and they were easy enough! JupyterHub is very easy to use.	Reading through material was interesting but i do not like reading materials so I think that was the worst part.	3 : 6-10 Hours
exercises were simple and it was easy to get help in garages.	'Some fast recap how matrices work would have been more helpful because I don''t really remember.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Plotting and linear algebra assignments simply because they are something I am interested in.	I found some concepts like labels, features and hypothesis space hard to understand at first because I find that the names dont really reflect what they are and they are represented in a quite a complicated way in the book.	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 3. eigenvectors - It just felt so great when i finally managed to plot eigenvectors starting from zero and i got those vectors scaled by eigenvalues :)	Idk. Maybe the part where i stumbled with not knowing that i have to tranpose the matrix before it can be used in the cov-function.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The best part was the Jupyter Notebook, as the question were well made, were neither too hand-holding nor too crazy hard.	'Maybe the reading part. The text is very technical and some of the concepts are a bit cryptic at this point. Maybe it''s just my rusty linear algebra talking.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Apple example was good because it gave concrete understanding of modelling the ML problem.	I am not sure if I understood the Task 3 Eigenvectors so well. Also it took lots of time to figure out how to plot the lines from origo [0,0] to the eigenvector value.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The jupyter notebook was well written and the instructions easy to follow	'The eigenvector task was a bit of a jump in difficulty, I didn''t undertand how to use the numpy functions correctly at first.&nbsp;'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I think the best part was all the programming exercises because I thought it was fun and I reminder on the subject of vectors and matrices.	'I think the worst part was the quiz because I felt like some of the answer for the questions couldn''t be found in the course material.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The book was very clear.	Coding bit was a bit unnecessary	2 : 1-5 hours
I like matrices.	Could be more matrices.	2 : 1-5 hours
Python exercises cleared the topics quite nicely, also the matrix algebra in the quiz was a good memory refresher	Learning new names for old topics in regression	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked all the programming exercises this round as they were a nice way to get in touch with numpy and plotting with Python.	I would like to learn more about loss function and hypothesis space (and maybe some other topics) via doing exercises or reading online instead of going through a book.	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 2. Good beginning for Python beginners.	Task 3. The use and meaning of the eigenvectors is still a mystery.	2 : 1-5 hours
All the python modeling exercises were fun and educating. I really like seeing theory in practice	'The first part of the quiz was a little bit tedious and hard. My theoretical knowledge wasn''t enough at that time to answer then correctly'	3 : 6-10 Hours
3.exercise was the most fun for me, mainly because it was nice to plot the eigenvectors on top of data.	The matrix inverse question of the quiz was the most confusing because of one techicality that you could consider 0 a positive number.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Briefly reviewing basic linear algebra and python is a great idea for a course like this.	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The coding exercises were good, since numpy and pandas is probably pretty new to most of the students, so it''s good to start from the basics. Task 3 was probably the best, since it had both linear algebra and plotting.'	'Reading the course book this early in the course shouldn''t be mandatory. Therefore I think it was silly that reporting typos in the book gives you points.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Question 2. Good start for the new comers into Python.&nbsp;	Since it is a introduction part nothing of that been faced	2 : 1-5 hours
Exercises were relatively easy and instructions were good.&nbsp;	The second question on the quiz. Nothing about it on the material (book nor coding exercises), so very hard to answer.Also, there is quite a bit of this "we will talk about it in the future" stuff during lectures, which can be a bit off-putting.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Best part was learn how to print data in different types with python. Before I has only use matlab for that.	Worst part was that I did not understand first what is range. Or that is not same that in mathematics.	2 : 1-5 hours
Programming excerices were the most enjoyable part	Worst part was having to read the long pdf	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the third exercise as it gave me the most headache. Note to self: read numpy documentation before using its functions.	'I can''t think of anything that I would consider bad.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'I didn''t know about the existence of the pandas library before, so i''m glad that it was introduced this early. I have a bad tendency to parse text files by hand, which ends up taking longer than necessary. I''ll likely use it in future exercises too.'	I have a hard time reading text where functions and mathematical representations are inserted inside of sentences. Because the material is full of these abstracts, I need to be extra careful that I actually understand what I read.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I think all the exercises were quite trivial. I can''t say the best or worst part of this round. For someone who has not programmed python, all of the exercises are necessary.'	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
An overall introduction to Python Math Libraries (such as numpy) and the syntax of them. The mathematics in the exercise was quite simple, so it was easy to adapt libraries meanings and functions.&nbsp;	It was difficult to understand stuff in the course book at least in practise. The coding assignment was quite easy, but the topics of the book was high level.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Playing with python libraries and getting familiar with their functionality.	-0	2 : 1-5 hours
Plotting of scatterplots was the best because it showed different parts of the data which was interesting. However this round was very easy.	'The basic plotting was so basic that it didn''t give anything new for me.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Loss function	Hypothesis space was a bit unclear.	2 : 1-5 hours
Excercise 3. Plotting eigenvalues was good excercise for the matplotlib use and showed concretically properties of the eigenvectors.	Task1. There could be some more information why this sigmoid function is important and maybe a little bit more complex assignment.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I enjoyed the third exercise, because it included many useful numpy functions. Also, I feel like I learnt some useful python tricks along the way.	I think Loss function was the hardest topic to understand.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Plotting data was fun.	It was not really clear what you should plot on the same plots or different plots from the exercise descriptions.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
No specific task as they were all quite similar. It was nice with easier problems so one could get re-aquaintaned with Python.	Not remembering the Python syntax.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked to get to know to matplotlib library	'Pretty heavy reading task since the notation is super formal mathematically. Simple explanations of these notations would be nice, since the concepts aren''t really that difficult to understand.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Python notebook, actual hands-on learning	'Reading the book, I was very tired and didn''t understand much'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked most of the applied examples of how machine learning is used. They even helped to understand why the mathematical notations.	'I would have like to have seen how are these basic operations utilized in machine learning rather than just doing simple maths. I hope you haven''t made this course easier just because there are more people on it.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
There was not any particular part that stood out as being particularly spectacular, though starting off with something relatively easy was a nice way oof refreshing my memories on python and its syntax.	The questions from the course book could have been more clearly integrated into the rest of the problems.	2 : 1-5 hours
Pretty sure everything went well, good starting off point and all that. I thought I had already filled this out?	Some slightly awkwardly worded tasks but mostly just me being rusty with python.	2 : 1-5 hours
All the topics were interesting and thus "best part". 	none	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I really enjoyed reading chapter 2 of the book. It was very thorough, and explained in depth the concepts of features, labels, spaces etc, but didn''t use overly complicated language. Even an idiot like me could understand most of it.'	'Plotting the data in exercise round 1. I didn''t feel like I learned anything during that exercise.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'The material started from quite simple things and programming exercises were easy enough to do even though I haven''t been programming too much lately.'	Article "an" before abbreviation "ML". Very annoying in the course book if you read "ML" as machine learning rather than "em el".	3 : 6-10 Hours
I really enjoyed working on the notebook. The way the exercises are done is intuitive and clear. I enjoyed learning about the basic blocks that make a ML solution.	I found that looking for typos in the course book was a bit strange. I missed the first lecture and it was most likely covered there.. I think that rather than making it "mandatory" to keep an eye out for typos there should be a sort of reward system for those interested in reporting such things. Just my opinion on it...	2 : 1-5 hours
The exercise on extracting eigenvectors and -values. I was not aware of that numpy function.	The exercise was quite short, and did not offer very much for someone with basic prerequisite knowledge of Python and numpy. I guess it is more optimal for complete beginners.	2 : 1-5 hours
The programming exercises, they gave hands on -experience.	'The quiz. I don''t think time limited quiz is the best way to test understanding.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The topic of labels and features was interesting and pretty well written so it was pretty easy to understand.	'Hypothesis space because I didn''t really understand it. I''m not that familiar and comfortable with all the mathematical notation so it would be nice if there would be some explanation first without them. Also the task 0 of the notebook did not prepare for the task 0 section of the quiz at all in my opinion so i had some trouble answering the questions regarding task 0.'	5 : more than 20 hours
Practical exercises with python. Because you learn by doing.	The coursebook was somehow difficult to understand as I have no technical background from the topic. Maybe more emphasis on different examples would be good way to illustrate the concepts.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 2. Files. Teaches to load the files and plot data.NB: PLEASE FIX TASK 2.1 SENTENCE - IT MISLEADS TO THINK THAT N = 2 AND D = 600!!!	Task 3. Eigenvectors. The eigenvalues and -vectors meaning (or the point) is not explained.NB: PLEASE FIX TASK 2.1 SENTENCE - IT MISLEADS TO THINK THAT N = 2 AND D = 600!!!	4 : 10-20 hours
'To be honest, all of the Python tasks were beneficial as I''m unfamiliar with Python.&nbsp;'	I have no criticism for this first round.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
The python exercises were simple, but useful. 	The textbook has way too much theretical jargon which makes it very hard to read and understand.	4 : 10-20 hours
Features and labels, mainly because of the easy-to-grasp and interesting examples.	'The jupyter notebook exercises felt a bit useless, but that''s probably more due to me hating the platform.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I found the course book really well written. Good information in compact enough space! The Rumba example helps to understand everything really well...!	Worst part was maybe getting everything to run on my Windows computer, anaconda did not work well and I did not get all packets installed using pip so I decided to use the cloud instead. The Cloud thing works quite well so I am happy about that.	4 : 10-20 hours
- Programming assignment. I feel that doing is easily the best way of learning things (for me anyway).	Quiz. Not really all that bad. I just felt that some of the answer choices were ambiguous.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I generally enjoyed the programming and plotting involved in all three subtasks - it was something more hands-on on an otherwise very theoretical course.	While none of the exercises was bad per se or leave room for pedagogical improvement, I personally found the linear algebra / vector algebra as something I needed to refresh my memory on.	3 : 6-10 Hours
This was a great first round all in all. Thanks	Eigen values were a bit tricky to plot correctly.&nbsp;Also at the beginning there was some confusion with rows and columns, feature vector wether those are pictures or pixels , or.&nbsp;If you can explain them in several concrete examples, it would be amazing.Thanks	2 : 1-5 hours
Hypothesis space	It would be nice to conceretly see data dimensions in examples in the book, so not to confuse labels and features as concepts.	2 : 1-5 hours
The Elements of a ML Problem: the key elements are explained very well and thereare illustrative examples as well.	Introduction: I think the relation between ML and AI is not elaborated clearly.	2 : 1-5 hours
feature part. The concept became clear after this round.&nbsp;	'Quiz related to matrix multiplication. I don''t have clue where to find information from.&nbsp;'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task #4: It made me remember the eigenvalue, eigenvector decomposition of the matrices. It made me think for a while, it was not that systematic.	Task 0: matrices. There was not even a code to write there (or then I misunderstood and forgot to do it)	2 : 1-5 hours
Actually the whole jupyter book. Was good to start with really easy assignments to get to know the notebook layout and the libraries. They were also directly hands on with questions that have clear answers that can be confirmed through other sources before handing it in. Keep this up!	Quiz - questions about matrixes when they were according to me not in the slides or exercises as much. -&gt; Okey good to refresh or learn needed aspects anyway but quiez questions should be based on the lectures and assignments to act as check for what I know or what I need to train more on after the first attempt or what not.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Part two was really nice and visual.	Part three was a good topic but I would have required some more step by step introductions to handle the eigenvector decomposition	2 : 1-5 hours
The best part of this round was doing the hands-on exercises. Especially, I enjoyed tasks 1-2, because I learned to plot in Python.	'The worst parts of this round were tasks 3.3-3.5, because I didn''t quite understand what I was supposed to do.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Hypothesis space was intresting concept which I found difficult to understand properly.	I prefer to read instead of doing coding assignments so the hands-on part was the worst part.	4 : 10-20 hours
I liked how the roomba example had a major part in explaining features, labels and the hypothesis space. Math equations can have a frightening effect on me so it is always nice to have some roombas.	'Jupyter seemed a little volatile as I couldn''t use it on the last day. Topics were cool though.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Best part were the coding exercises, as they were more about problem solving.&nbsp;	'Reading the course book was quite painful, and I''d hope it would be even more based on examples and cases. Especially the loss functions were challenging to understand.&nbsp;'	4 : 10-20 hours
The course book chapter(s) was a good and clear resource for understanding the basics.	'Same questions in a quiz that you can complete three times. You can get a decent grade with trial and error and if you have any friends that''s even easier. I''m not sure how well that measures your learning.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Good thing the coruse didn''t gloss over any of the basics.'	Nothing that bad in the round. It was fairly easy.	1 : less than 1 hour
The python exercises were quite fun and it was nice to see the results instantly in the notebook	nothing particular	3 : 6-10 Hours
Using concrete examples in lectures made the concepts much more easy to understand. It was also good to practise using python for plotting functions.	It was hard to see a clear link between the python notebook and the lectures. The loss functions were somewhat hard to understand and I felt like they were explained the least compared to other topics.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
The best part was plotting graphs, and visualising the given data. This gave a better understanding of what the data holds, and visualising eigen vectors gave an understanding of how the actually relate to the data. This was fun!	The worst part was having to google python syntax all the time, as I have only completed an introductory course to python.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
The best part of this round was the JupyterHub and the excercises in there. The Jupyter is nice environmet to do little coding assigments and I actually learned some python. This is helpful for my work :) 	The hyphotesis space was unclear for me, so that is the worst part. 	4 : 10-20 hours
Best was to learn how to use Jupyter notebook. It is a nice tool.	That one did not know if it was meaning to try to find typos in material to get points. That would have been better clarified.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The notebook. It was relatively easy to understand and running coding assignments on it with all the materials at the same place is convenient.	'The quiz''s multiple choice of plots. I chose the wrong answer because the letter was in an ambiguous place.'	4 : 10-20 hours

-0	-0	2 : 1-5 hours
Features	Hypothesis space	2 : 1-5 hours
The python exercises were fun, great hands-on refresher on linear algebra.	'In the quiz the images and radio buttons are not vertically aligned, so it''s easy to unintentionally choose wrong answer.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The scatter plot was best. Important coding functions.	'The quiz was worst part. Even with right plots I first chose wrong options, because the labeling of the options was misleading as the option labels weren''t centered.'	4 : 10-20 hours
The course book was excellent. I read the 2 first chapters already on the previous week and understanding everything on the lecture was easy.	'The quizzes first 2 questions were quite hard, since the Linear algebra &amp; matrix operations weren''t very clear in my memory. Maybe you have something ready made cheat sheets for matrix operations that you could share for the students?'	4 : 10-20 hours
The distinct definitions of key concepts - features, labels, hypothesis, and loss function were defined very well. (Part 2 - Components of a ML problems)	No particular bad part of this round.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The example of finding correlation between the prices of crypto-currencies was good as it was engaging and showed a potential real world application at the same time.	While the eigenvalue decompositions were very relevant to the subject overall, I felt they could have been introduced better in this first round (They do not come up again until the last round).	2 : 1-5 hours
'The substance exercises were straightforward and relevant, nice to do. However, I was familiar with the topics beforehand so it wasn''t too much of a challenge. Not a problem though'	Typo finding	2 : 1-5 hours
The Roomba examples in the course book was an interesting start to the course, in providing a real life example of ML applications and problems.	The exercises were basically a python tutorial instead of actual machine learning which made the exercises seem kind of pointless.	2 : 1-5 hours
Loved the coding. Extremely well done notebook exercices!!	Trying to find mistakes from the text...	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Coding exercises support learning a lot, especially because it''s been a while since last coding with Python!Coding platform is really easy to use!'	I think there was nothing bad in this round.	4 : 10-20 hours
The exercise task2 with colored clusters and their histograms was a nice introduction to basic reasoning of data graphs in my opinion.&nbsp;	The worst part was my personal choice of starting it too late, not being familiar with the 3 attempts rule, and in general trying to get a new coding framework to work at the last minute.	2 : 1-5 hours
3 exercise was good. I have calculated eigenvectors and eigenvalues at least in 3 different math courses. This was the first time that I actually understood where you can use those values and why the are calculated.In addition, I think that it is good to have this kind of intoduction round where you have time to figure out the software and play with the jupyter notebook by yourself.	Exercise 1. It was too easy, although it was not a bad exercise.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The apple app example on lectures has been easy to follow through different topics and has helped put all topics into a larger framework	Mandatory open questions in feedback feel tedious, but I guess they are useful for gathering data on how to improve the course	2 : 1-5 hours
The coding assignment. It was a good refresher on Python and and introduction to the course topic.	The exercise return system. It left me uncertain whether my coding assignment submission has been accepted.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 2 was great for me because as a mechanical engineer and working with CFD it helped me to understand the data.	Eigenvector and eigenvalues. I solved it but do not understand their physical meaning.	2 : 1-5 hours
first exercise because was easy	last exercises because they are hard	3 : 6-10 Hours
Doing the exercise in the exercise session and getting help.&nbsp;Why: Because it made me understand better and have better picture.	The worst parts were doing this alone at home.	4 : 10-20 hours
'After seeing the teacher''s answers I have understood the problem and how to solve it'	Hypothesis space exercise was hard because I did not really get first what to do in it and how the inputs work.	4 : 10-20 hours
'After seeing the teacher''s answers I have understood the problem and how to solve it'	Hypothesis space exercise was hard because I did not really get first what to do in it and how the inputs work.	4 : 10-20 hours
&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;	5 : more than 20 hours
The assignment, nice to get hands dirty right away!	None	2 : 1-5 hours
Eigenvalue and eigenvector are the terms that I found the most helpful for me this week because I heard about them before but do not really spend time on understanding it.&nbsp;Basically, a scalar λ is called an eigenvalue of the n × n matrix A if there is a nontrivial solution x of Ax = λx. Such an x is called an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ.	I do not see anything which can be considered the worst part because I learnt&nbsp;something from all of the topic covered this week.	2 : 1-5 hours
Loss functions and using them to build Machine learning. I had never quite understood how machine learning worked before. It was interesting to finally understand how they could actually be made.	Coding assignment. It was a bit silly just looking up python functions in the docs and pretty much just inserting them into the file as is.	2 : 1-5 hours
Eigenvectors seemed very useful and have never used it for a dataset	The way the N and d were depicted in the Quiz versus the rest of the material was really puzzling and confusing	3 : 6-10 Hours
The first exercise because that was not really covered in the lecture.	'The first question. I appreciate math and theory has to be well understood but Im wasn''t sure where I could find the information to answer that question.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Introduction to the basic terms in ML	Everything was ok	4 : 10-20 hours
Video lectures are the best because of 1,25 fast forwarding!	N/A	4 : 10-20 hours
'Eigenvectors.It was possible to see visually the relation between the data set and the vectors'' direction and length.'	The mathematics is always abstract to read if not used to it.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The programming task related to eigenvectors. I had already practiced some plotting, and in this exercise the plot made sense, since the eigenvectors and the scatterplot related to each other. I plotted the eigenvectors in a wrong manner, as I took the rows to be the eigenvectors and not the columns. The plot seemed weird, and so I looked more carefully into the exercise. So it was also good personal learning experience. I also liked that it was a combination of mathematics, coding and visualisation, so that all parts came together. It was also important that there were those previous tasks that prepared for this tasks. They were much less fun, very frustrating for someone totally new to python.	'The quiz was ethically very questionable as a gradable course assignment, and I find this a serious transgression. Many questions were directly dependent on having SUCCESSFULLY completed the coding exercises. I think this type of a dependence is academically unethical. Everyone should have an equal chance at answering the questions of the quiz, independent of the coding exercises.  Only such questions should be asked that they are based on different numbers, data and specific equations (such as that for plotting the graph in the task 1) than what was used in the coding exercises.I understand that sometimes within one set of tasks, there are dependencies, just like in the coding exercise. But whenever there are dependencies between separate assignments, the correct answers to the previous ones should be made available to the students. One could think this also in the following way: if the quiz was part of the coding exercise, would it make sense to have such questions? Would it be reasonable to ask, for example, which graph is correct, or which were the values of the eigenvector? Would it make sense to give points from such questions, if the coding tasks themselves are graded as well?I have to say, I am actually considering taking this matter to the dean, because of the unethical aspects, and I fully expect that the results of the quiz will be nullified for the ethically questionable parts to rectify the situation. Furthermore, I expect that for all subsequent quizes, there will be no such dependence that I described here.I understand that the course might be based on a teaching philosophy with an ethical dimensions that justify the above described dependence. If that is the case, I would very much like to hear the thoughts and justifications of the responsible teacher for the course. I hope that whoever ends up reading this answer, would relay it to the responsible teacher of the course. As I''m not sure, whether my contact details are visible for the person checking this answer, I leave my contact details here: tmi.otto.schultz@gmail.com (or in case you prefer using my Aalto mail, as the subject is somewhat sensitive, that would be otto.schultz@aalto.fi)'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Loss Function was explained pretty clearly.&nbsp;Practical coding excercises	Eigenvectors definitions are quite confusing for me. I will not say it the worst but compared to other parts, I will name this one.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Exercise 2. As I haven''t used that much Python, I had to use more time in getting to know the basic Python features and that question really helped me to understand how to plot graphs in Python. Plotting exercise 3 was then easy and exercise 1 did not make me to dig so deep into the parameters of the plot functions.'	3. Since it has been some time from last Matrix manipulation that I was able to produce the eigenvectors but the meaning of it did not open up 100%. However, this might need some further reading from my part.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Working with&nbsp;matplotlib.pyplot library.You learn a nice practical way of presenting visualizations of your data to yourself and others.	'Eigenvectors.&nbsp;There is a deeper meaning for computing the eigenvectors and values for a matrix. There could''ve been more insight of the purpose of these.'	4 : 10-20 hours
scatter plot task was useful for learning to use matplotlib	'can''t think of anything specific'	4 : 10-20 hours
Calculating the total amount of hypotheses. Showed the enormity of the problem. And also numbers are fun.	'I did not like the bitcoin example. I would have liked more if we''d predicted the value of bitcoin tomorrow. That''s what you would want to know.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
PCA	Formalism e.g. hypothesis spaces of innumerable size (such as all Python functions that perform in less than 10 seconds). Skip the formalism and concentrate on algorithms (Python code is helpful, math notation not so much).	3 : 6-10 Hours
Overall concept was clearly explained ( features/labels/hypothesis space ...) Like to learn Pandas / numpy / matplotlib too.	My linear algebra is little rusty, need to rehearse :P	3 : 6-10 Hours
All the general definitions related to the Machine Learning such as Features, Labels and Loss Function explained perfectly with the given proper examples.	The connection between detecting apple, for example, in a drawing and starting to write a function for that is still unclear for me.I would like to know in what way a function could help us or software to decide if the drawing shows an apple or not.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The overall idea on how to start constructing a machine learning problem was the most important part for me	Hypothesis spaces, the concept was confusing at first	3 : 6-10 Hours
The exercises were a nice reminder on how to use numpy and matplotlib.	Nothing, everything was okay.	2 : 1-5 hours
The first assignment where we used numpy to draw a plot. Quite useful.	All exercises were kinda the same, hard to pick any one particular.	2 : 1-5 hours
Introduction to Jupyter. I had never used it before and always done everything with Vim + Python on a command line.	'I did not like the fact there was a time limit for the quiz. There was plenty of time, but it still introduced quite a bit of extra stress. I honestly don''t see the point of having a limit.I am also somewhat confused when it comes to the grading. I cannot see my grade from the quiz anywhere. The summary of previous attempts of Quiz 1 says that review will be available once the round closes. The grades panel on the sidebar also fails to show the amount of points collected.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'Overall, the python notebook was certainly good for the people with less experience. For someone who''s getting paid for doing data science with Python, it was a fun little warmup.'	The first exercise felt a bit out of place.	1 : less than 1 hour
It was just about learning/remembering Python after many years of Matlab. 	The instructions in the third section were not that clear. 	2 : 1-5 hours
python link was so much of helppart one and two exercise was practical implementation&nbsp;which further strength the knowledge&nbsp;	I had problems with&nbsp;eigenvalue and eigenvectorsnot int the computation of it but rather from understanding its meaning or the reason behind it&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
Programming exercise. The student really has to focus on the data to determine right answers, gives insights more than just reading.	Quiz questions about typos. Impossible to find typos and trying to focus on the content at the same time.	4 : 10-20 hours
Programming , good to find questions related to that in quiz.	Nothing here.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The best part for me is the Rumba example. Even though there are lot''s of terminologies, jargon and theory: which makes is hard to follow; Rumba just gives you a clear picture of how these things can be used in practice.&nbsp;'	'One thing that I found bad is getting lost while reading the course book''s section 1, 2. Especially, when it comes to all the mathematical inference. I see this as a personal issue, but not the course related stuff and hope that over time it will be better.&nbsp;'	4 : 10-20 hours
I really like the structure of the course and the concept in general. This great that we have JupyterLab assignments and can get hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms along with the theory.	I think the most challenging (not the worst) part is finding matrix eigenvalues (eigenvectors) as it is not clearly explained why this is important.	2 : 1-5 hours
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Even though they were noe explained, they are essential in linear algebra.&nbsp;	The jupyter environment is not that good.	2 : 1-5 hours
The basic exercises were wery good to start with, good round.	'I didn''t have any bigger problems this round'	2 : 1-5 hours
Tasks 2,3: learning some pandas, numpy and matplotlib was nice and the exercises were clear and simple which demonstrated the topics well.	All were fine. The exercises were a soft and nice introduction to the topics, nothing bad to say.	2 : 1-5 hours
I think the best part was the chapter 2 of the course book because it gave a pretty good summary of machine learning as a whole.	'I don''t really like the IPython notebooks (in general; not just in this case). They make testing the code harder than is necessary and promote the use of global variables which are evil.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the way the quiz tested if one had done the programming exercises. Made the programming feel more "rewarding".	'I felt a bit cheated with one of the quiz on the eigenvector question with the answer with the reversed vector being correct swell. Sure it could just be that I don''t understand linear algebra well enough yet &nbsp;but asked about it in Slack. The python notebook got a little bit messy with the different plots being generated.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'Task 3 was nice, haven''t worked with matrices for a while. How to scatterplot was also good to memorize'	Working too late :)	2 : 1-5 hours
I really liked the lectures this far.	I have a reading disorder and found It hard to read the course book, as the margins were justified and the font was in serif. It would be really nice if their was an easy-read version of the book.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The coding because it gives a sense of accomplishment when you get the correct answer	'Reading, it''s dull and I feel I don''t retain it very well'	2 : 1-5 hours
Best part was that students were to only fill blank spaces instead of creating something from zero which is the policy in some courses, e.g. "straight to the deep end of the pool".	Cannot name any.	2 : 1-5 hours
The coding exercise was especially helpful as I had no previous experience in using Python.	'The quizz question 7 was pointless since the point locations in a scatter plot don''t change when points are colored.'	2 : 1-5 hours
-0	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
Abstract concept of hypothesis space I found interesting, also examples in material were intriquing.	My local jupyter uses different version of python so print works with different syntax which was a bit annoying.	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked Task 2: Files the most in this round, as it was straightforward and helped understand the concept of features better. 	Task 3 - Eigenvectors could use some python tips, for example mention how pyplot.plot connects two points (which is quite counter-intuitive).	2 : 1-5 hours
&nbsp;Loss function	Linear algebra	3 : 6-10 Hours
Features and labels were the best part because they were the core point of it.	Hypothesis space was addressed too little.	2 : 1-5 hours
The eigenvector of the covariance matrix stuff was pretty cool. It was nice to see that the eigenvectors actually made sense with respect to the data.	'Task 1 wasn''t very exciting, as I have used matplotlib before and the differentiation of the function wasn''t very interesting either. '	2 : 1-5 hours
The coding assignment was the best part of this round because I learned how to use matplotlib&nbsp;to create nice plots.	This feedback quiz is the worst part of this round because answering these questions is not interesting for me.	2 : 1-5 hours
Feature vectors because I feel that they are important	'Last question because I couldn''t compeletely understand it'	2 : 1-5 hours
plottingvisualizing data is fun	Eigenvalues	2 : 1-5 hours
Questions requiring more interpretation: Q17 Labels. Why: requires own understanding and use of knowledge.&nbsp;	Visuality of assignments: multiple choice questions with graphs were easily answered wrong.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Overall the fact that plots are used a lot to look at the data and that vectors were drawn on the data to see what the covariance means on the data.	'Personally using python was the worst part, but I managed easily, it wasn''t that bad. I have no former experience in python.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The intoductory Jupyter assignments were decent - worked well and did their job.	The introduction of the course book jolts rapidly between applied formulations and more formal notation, which makes it unnecessarily challenging to distinguish the elements of notation that are intended to be generalized.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
I thought that the feature vectors were explained very well.	'I didn''t really grasp the concept of hypothesis space.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the process of going from datapoints--&gt;features--&gt;labels. It really opened up what machine learning really is.	Coding really is not my forte and it gave me some headache, but i still want to learn it. Slack really helped in many cases though.	4 : 10-20 hours
coding with python, because it was most fun and challenging	reading through the material.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Python notebook exercises and quiz generally good	- There could have been more exercises- No previous material on covariance matrix	2 : 1-5 hours
Labels and features were explained well.	I had some trouble following the idea of hypothesis space and the loss function.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I like the Jupyter notebook somehow. The exercises were hands-on which made the theory concrete. Handling data and graphing it made it easier to understand how one analyzes data.However, the Jupyter notebooks were explained weirdly. I constantly did wrong because I did not understand the exercises. Please copy the task for each into the code comments if you decide to keep the comments, one automatically reviews them instead of the text above.	The first question on the quiz was, in my opinion, the worst. I do understand that we have to have some background of linear algebra and such, but the questions were still very unexpected and could not have (easily) been solved with the information of the course.In general the exercise descriptions in the Jupyter notebooks were not of good quality. The descriptions could also be in the code comments and maybe refactored a bit.	2 : 1-5 hours
I think that chapter 2 as a whole gave a pretty good introduction to basics of machine learning problems. It was also nice in some way that exercises and quiz questions made me review concepts of linear algebra that I had not used for a while. 	I might be a bit biased, but the second quiz question about invertible matrices took me a bit by surprise (rusty linear algebra skills), it would have been nice to have an exercise in the jupyter notebook that would have pointed that it might be worth reviewing that topic. 	3 : 6-10 Hours
learning syntax	Too easy	2 : 1-5 hours
The task three was the best because it made me think about how the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix correspond to the data.	'The second matrix question in the quiz was a bit tricky. I don''t know if it''s basic matrix knowledge to know that transpose(X)*X + a*I is invertible.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
all of them	the last question on the notebook	2 : 1-5 hours
The one with histogram. I had little to almost no knowledge regarding why it is used for. However, after going through the exercise, lecture notes and chapters in the book, I now bear some competent knowledge on the same. Looking forward to gaining more in the upcoming days.&nbsp;	Nothing looked like the worst part in this exercise round. I aim to grab and build as much knowledge as I can and I am happy that I am getting to learn new things via this course.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the python exercises.Even though I understand when Alex talks about feature vectors and matrices in the lecture, it is quite nice to be able to operate with real data and get a feel of what these things look like in practice.I like how the exercises breach the gap between understanding the theory and being able to apply that theory.	'I didn''t like the instructions for the task 3 of the python notebook exercise.I didn''t know exactly what eigenvectors were and I think a link there to some basic idea/documentation would have been nice (similar to the other tasks that had links to relevant documentation).Even though I plotted my data correctly quite quickly, it took a long time before I understood well what it meant'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Features and labels	Hypothesis part relatively difficult then others but not worst	3 : 6-10 Hours
All the topics are good. The notes have the simple and easy way of explanation by taking real examples. 	'For me, I didn''t get the importance of the weight vectors (W), how to find the exact values for this weight function for that particular application. '	4 : 10-20 hours
Working with the dataset and creating different plots form it.	Matrix and vector part. Those should be known from previous courses.	2 : 1-5 hours
I think it was important to get to know the basic structures of machine learning, i.e. data points (features, labels), loss function and hypothesis space.	Dealing with the csv files in the exercise was a bit confusing to me first. I was wondering, if all the rows were feature vectors, what would then be the labels and thus, how should I make the scatter plots. In the end I managed to do them correctly, though. So no labels needed.	4 : 10-20 hours
The good part was about manipulating and cooking data using jupyter notebook. This because i have previous exposure to jupyter usage.&nbsp;	The difficult topic that happen to me was the exercise about eigen-vector, which i have to get back to mathematics.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I enjoyed plotting the data and the eigenvectors, because I''m keen to master the use of matplotlib.'	Maybe the part where one had to analyze the invertibility of the matrix product aT*a, as it was purely theoretical. But I do think that kind of exercises are useful from time to time as well.	2 : 1-5 hours
'The programming stuff is nice. Putting the theory into application kind of adds a legitimacy to what you''re learning'	-&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
'I like the Python excerise that is used for the quizz. It''s a good starter for a programming beginner like myself.'	'Asking about vector and matrix properties. I don''t know about different kinds of matrices and vectors, and if they''re invertible or not, what full rank means. But I can try to fill that knowledge gap.'	5 : more than 20 hours
Features I guess. I have done AI before, so I have the knowledge of what was in this round.	The notations. I am still getting used to the ML notations.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Jupyter-notebooks were good. It took time but was rewarding. I liked the eigenvector assignment the most.	Worst was to answer quizz. I hope grading has +1 for good excercises as those are in my opinion very rewarding, where as clicking the wrong option on multi-quizz could drop my grade significantly. I really do not like quizz based grading.	4 : 10-20 hours
Starting with python basics was a good thing. First example exercise of matrices was great.	Task 2 files. More precise information about the use of scatter plot.	4 : 10-20 hours
Exercise 3, as it helps me to have a good revision on Matrix.Explaination on learning curve is helpful.	A little bit too much theoretical explanation focus on the loss function of linear regression	2 : 1-5 hours
I do not know how to choose one, but for me the coding exercises in Jupyter notebook was great. It is a really good way to recall the knowledge and practice our skills. And besides, coding is fun. Too bad there are not many coding exercises, and they are not graded.	'I understand that the book was designed as a source of knowledge, in which each chapter represents a topic in ML, and for that reason, all the ideas related to a subject should be presented in the equivalent chapter. However, that may have made it a little bit overwhelming for beginners.&nbsp;As someone with prior knowledge regarding the topic, I feel that some of the terms explained in two first chapters are not crucial to start with ML. Maybe&nbsp;there shouldn''t be that many new terminologies used in first chapters of the book. I mean we can explain things a little bit less academically, and focus on some main ideas that are needed right now (For someone with little background, looking at a few first pages and see a bunch of difficult words felt like looking at a blank wall).&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;I feel that the explanation in the textbook is sometimes not very clear, for example I got stuck with the question regarding how many "elements" does a hypothesis space have for awhile, since in the section of hypothesis space, the word "element" was used in quite different scenarios, without clear differentiation (anyway, just my two-cent but I feel that the understanding of this concept is not important enough to be in the first lesson). Luckily, the TAs were available at all time and did a good job in clarifying the subject.'	2 : 1-5 hours
In introduction I liked the machine learning application to find the freezing point of the sea when it is appropriate to do skiing. 	Get all understood. For this round no worst part.	2 : 1-5 hours
Loss functions .&nbsp; When we predict some labels, we need to be quite sure at least (99%).&nbsp;	Hypothesis space. I did understand after reading for a while. I guess , I need to read bit more an linear algebra ( refreshing it )	3 : 6-10 Hours
The Python assignment	the explanation in course book needs to have more examples	3 : 6-10 Hours
I really liked the coding interface of the jypyter and the tasks layout. It is good for learning	'In the part where there was a need to upload files into jupyter it was not explained that it is possible to use just file names:df = pd.read_csv(''Data.csv'', sep='','')I wasted more than two hours trying the approaches with the downloading files like that (below) with the address of the filedf = pd.read_csv("https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi/user/vinogra1/edit/notebooks/01%20-%20Introduction/Data.csv")'	2 : 1-5 hours
The description on labels , features and&nbsp; data point was elaborate enough to understand them.	Loss functions. I just could not wrap my head around it. Also, for somebody like me who is learning basic principles in machine learning the example of image identification can be a bit challenging&nbsp; right in the first lecture :)	5 : more than 20 hours
I really enjoyed reading the first chapter of the "Machine Learning: Basic Principles" course book. It gave a good overview of ML and the broad spectrum of its applications. I also thought it did a good job of explaining how ML fits in with AI. Although now it seems ridiculous, before reading that first chapter I thought that ML was higher on the hierarchy than AI when it comes to "smart" computing.	'The worst part of this round was trying to understand section 2.2 of the course book. The Hypothesis Space  was a very difficult concept to grasp based on the provided material. It could have to do with my lack of familiarity with the notation, but this didn''t hinder my understanding of Features and Labels.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Terminology and approach to machine learning was nice to learn and clearly presented.	Matrix and vector operations and syntax takes a bit of getting used to again as it has been a while since I studied or used it. However will also be useful and needed.	2 : 1-5 hours
The notebook tasks were good, I learned a bit of the basics numpy and matplotlib.	There are too many questions in the quiz, each time I tried it I accidentally answered some questions wrong even though I knew the right answer.	3 : 6-10 Hours
This is not necessary "a topic" but it is superb that I amable to watch the recorded lectures afterwards:&nbsp; I can watch some difficult part as many times as&nbsp;I want until I understand it (assuming that I have enough time for that :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )	Some parts of the drawings on lecture 2 were little bit messy. Especially when the notations were rounded by pen afterwards.	5 : more than 20 hours
The lectures. They give concrete examples and clarify math which is my weak point.	Personally: I had trouble with python after long break with it.Material: there is very often "in what follows" in the text :)	3 : 6-10 Hours
Visualization.	No problems.	2 : 1-5 hours
The section 2 of the course book, because it opened some principles of machine learning the best for me.	I had to google myself how to use the libraries needed in the exercises, but atleast the descriptions were clear enough to understand what to google exactly.	2 : 1-5 hours
Leacures easy to follow, course book is EXCELLENT and really easy to understand!!!	Loss function was a bit too much for the first lecture (after 1h...)	4 : 10-20 hours
'Labels - I considered this to be the easiest to understand because I had prior knowledge about them having worked with them in the past. There are the part of data that measuring isn''t quite hard and thus made me understand them better.&nbsp;'	The plotting parts were quite challenging as there were not documentations provided that would have helped and made the work easier. Nonetheless, googling brought much more and in this way enabled me to learn more about different Python libraries and how they are used.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
The second lecture of round 1 was the best part of this round. It was great that we went through the lecture 1 topics once again with a very clear example. The professor did an outstanding job with illustrating and drawing the topics, and finally linking them together.	The loss function was maybe the hardest of topics to grasp and understand at first from the grounds of lecture 1. Lecture 1 was quite unrevealing in the end. Thank you though for going it all over once again in lecture 2!!	3 : 6-10 Hours
Each and Every part is interesting especially this round is good start for basics of python libraries. The pandas library looks interesting to me for loading, manipulating and plotting the data.	There is nothing like that I feel as a worst part. Each and every exercise is very interesting to learn about basics of python libraries.	3 : 6-10 Hours

There is nothing like that I feel as a worst part. Each and every exercise is very interesting to learn about basics of python libraries.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Hard to choose but I would say task 2 because the instructions were clear and the results showed clearly how this could be useful to know i.e. how to get the size of a matrix and how to divide it to parts etc.	'I wouldn''t say any of these tasks were bad but in the task 3 the instructions were a bit unclear and e.g. 3.2 was already done so it was first unclear what to do...'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The best part of this round was eigen values and eigen vectors.I was not familiar with this concept after doing round 1 eercise, i got the understanding of this concept.	The whole exercise was quite interesting, cant think of any worst part.	2 : 1-5 hours
The best part of this round was to visualize the data, sample covariance with different plots such as the&nbsp;scatter plot, histogram plot etc.	I think there was no part of the quiz that was worst for this round. Overall the quiz was very interesting.	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 0:&nbsp;Good to know the basic functions before starting the exercises.	Task 3:Hard to understand the underlying math although the python exercises were pretty easy.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The best part of this round were the coding part combined with the teachings of the lectures. This "mix" made my understand basic concepts clearly.	Maybe the worst part was understanding the notations.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Introduction chapter of the book. It had fun and clear examples that were easy to understand as a beginner.	I had to google a lot of matplotlib functions. There could be a cheatsheet for the exercises.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Whole Python Notebook exercise were good, especially the last one (eigenvalues&amp;-vectors) which combined all previous exercises and some theory but were still not too complicated. 	'Nothing was really in bad shape, maybe lecture notes were a bit difficult to understand/merge to lecture slides if one couldn''t attend the lecture (my bad, should maybe have checked the video lectures).'	4 : 10-20 hours
I thought that the chapter about loss functions was really interesting, and got me thinking about the difficulty of rewarding/punishing the AI.	'I didn''t quite grasp the exercise on page 16 in the book. However, I haven''t watched the lecture recordings yet, so that might really be my own fault.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I liked the whole introduction, because it gave me a structured way of approaching the ML problems we''ll be looking at.'	I have to say that out of Stata, R and Java, Python seems to be the least user friendly and most demanding programming&nbsp; language.Although the logic behind it seems simple enough, I kept getting a lot of errors and deciphering what they meant was tedious.	5 : more than 20 hours
'I liked Task 1 where you where supposed to plot the sigmoid function and plot it''s derivative as well. It was the combination of math (differentiation) and python syntax (defining functions) that I liked, because I don''t have that much experience of programming in python yet. However, other langauges are familiar so I pick it up fast.'	It would have been nice to get a concrete example of what we do with eigenvalues/vectors in machine learning. "The largest eigenvalue indicates which direction the dataset varies the most", this was nice, but additionally a concrete example on how this should be interpreted would have been nice.	4 : 10-20 hours
I liked very much the lecture about the apple app.&nbsp;It provided a good overview about the whole ML process in easy to understand format.	I was hoping for more flexible deadlines for the quizzes (like last year) for completing the course. Fortunately, completing the quizzes was easy for the first round.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Getting familiar with the theoretical concepts and approach of machine learning. Basics of machine learning are interesting.&nbsp;	Non.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
Starting section of the coursebook is really clear and easy to understand.	'Oops. Forgot to fill in the feedback.Coursebook was so good that lectures didn''t add much value.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The second exercise I felt was very well written and helped me expand my knowledge on the topics.	Some of the quiz questions straight from the book I was unaware where exactly to start and stop reading for the quiz.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
Hot to specify a machine learning problem. It describes machine learning in summary and for what we need it.	-0	3 : 6-10 Hours
Applying the calculation to the exercises to create plot. I think creating plot helps understand principles faster and refresh the memory.	'The first part showing calculation using matrices was not really helping prepare yourself for the first couple of question of the quizz. It''s too bad since you anyway put the time to do the exercise.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The coding exercises on JupyterHub were very good and practical. It was a nice way to learn some basic Data Science with python.	There was none in my opinion	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 3 - Eigenvectors:&nbsp;It was fun recap of the topic.	There was none.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The data visualization part in the Python notebooks. It was nice to see what the data actually looks like and be able to visualize it.	Eigenvectors.I personally did not fully understand their concept and mathematical explanation.	2 : 1-5 hours
features, labels and hypothesis space. The topic was very interesting and intriguing.	Eigen value and vector. For me it is a bit confusing. Do takes a lot of time to understand.	4 : 10-20 hours
Features and labels	Difficulty with codes	3 : 6-10 Hours
The exercise where one had to do the eigenvalue decomposition on covariance matrix was kinda nice, even thought not really explained at all.	'1. In the course book basic concept were explained somewhat way too theoretically (especially the hypothesis space).&nbsp;2. The was the eigenvalue decomposition problem in programming exercises but really wasn''t explained at all.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Python	Python, because it did not have enough hints.	2 : 1-5 hours
Feature:It is well defined in the book and in the lecture.There are many examples given which explains.	Hypothesis space:There were not so many examples given for this part which I believe there sgould 	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 3. Got to use numpy more extensively	No complaints really.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 3 in the exercises visualized nicely the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix with respect to the data.	'I cannot think of anything bad. Well, maybe the assistant introduction could have been on the stage with microphones. I didn''t hear anything what they said.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Feature vectors. Because of the importance of these terminologies and the confusing explanation that is found on the internet.&nbsp;	Loss function part was a bit confusing and did not clear my concepts and would like to learn more about it.&nbsp;	5 : more than 20 hours
Emphasis and time spent on loss function and hypothesis space was good because they seem a bit trickier to understand as compared to other terminology.	Plotting of eigenvectors was a bit tricky since i mixed up the x1,x2 and y1,y2 values (interchanged, mistakenly)	3 : 6-10 Hours
Let say first exercise in the sense that it was easy to get started with the environment and with python language with quite little experiment beforehand from jupyter or python.	The different mathematical notation that I have used to. Apparently its of course very standard way in the field, but the bold letters etc. are not the most practical especially in hand written form.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Hypothesis Space&nbsp;	Features&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Was able to see the power of python packages. Though I do not always like the syntax, I can see there is a myriad of good functions available to me.	I think you left out what the dark/bad side of machine learning can be i.e. no mention of ethics. Which is something that should be at least stated in the first lecture. I have had other courses do this.The eradication of freedoms and privacy can easily happen. It seems you were eager to discuss what "we can do", but ignored the component of "however should we". 	3 : 6-10 Hours
I considered the python notebook exercise to be the best one as it required hands-on coding and understanding the given dataset using built-in python function. Reading the documentation for each function and getting results in visual format really sparked interest in learning the concepts.	Reading from the book and trying to figure out the concepts through the mathematical notations was perhaps the worst part. Although reading the notations was not difficult, following each and every detail in long paragraphs without practically solving any problem was what made me lose the plot.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I really liked working through the python scripts as I think this bettered my understanding.&nbsp;	As someone who has never used python before, it would be good to be directed to a help file. I am familiar with other coding languages so it was quick to pick up, however, something like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;(https://matplotlib.org/index.html) would be really useful for the "numpy" library or "pandas" package to know the correct commands.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
The third one because I could graphically see the use of eigenvectors and eigenvalues	It was short. Although I understand that people can take quite more time to do it	2 : 1-5 hours
Loss function and the explanation for it.&nbsp;	No particular one.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
Features and labels part were well exemplified with practical example.	Hypothesis Space due to mathematical complexity	4 : 10-20 hours
I think the first topic is the best part of this round because it is very interesting, attractive and not very hard to understand.	I think all topics and exercises in this round are fine, but sometimes the lecture is too fast to catch up, especially topic about Hypothesis Space&nbsp;.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Learning about Python in general. I had no previous experience	Reading features from the files. I had a bit trouble there and did not feel like wanting to use a lot of time on it	3 : 6-10 Hours
I love the Jupiter Notebook way of coding assignment. The detailed instructions are pretty useful not only for the assignment but also for future use.	'I can''t really follow the lecturer when drawing on iPad. Sometimes the hand written texts are hard to recognise.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I think the numpy introduction was good as it enables me to then use different functions using numpy.	'Plotting for me wasn''t so easy.&nbsp;'	4 : 10-20 hours
The best part of&nbsp; this part was the lecture 2 where Alex explained the elements of ML by an example on the virtual board. It was quite easy to follow although the subject is still tricky to me.	....	3 : 6-10 Hours
Eigenvalue and eigenvector, which is must needed	The basic exercises	1 : less than 1 hour
Understanding the main idea behind machine learning and its integration or application with many other fields.	Eigenvector, however was very theoretical and might need more emphasized.	5 : more than 20 hours
I liked the way exercise session was focused on introduction to using NumPy library and Python in general. It was a good start, having to read the data and plot the eigen vectors. 	The mathematical notation makes it look complicated where as in reality the concept is relatively easy and sometime one get stuck in the jargon used in the coursebook. 	2 : 1-5 hours
Calculation of eigenvectors and corresponding quiz. It is basic math but still forgot how to do it.&nbsp;	At the end of Chapter 2, there was briefly described Empirical average risk. That was so brief that it was difficult to understand.	2 : 1-5 hours
'I liked the explanation of features and datapoints. I''ve never completely understood the dynamics between those, but now it makes sense!'	The hypothesis space part is still pretty confusing. Maybe a bit more explanation of how ML algorithms determine possible candidates would be helpful?	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I liked the data handling and scatter plotting. I didn''t really remember how to do it and I think it''s quite useful to remember.'	I got a bit confused about the finding an optimal predictor thing. I would have thought that there should exist multiple good predictors which we would use depending on the situation.But I think I have to make some more work still on these basics to understand everything.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The whole exercise was easy because of basics.	'I couldn''t understand eigenvectors.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The loss function is the topic I liked best.&nbsp;	I liked all topics	4 : 10-20 hours
Plotting eigenvectors over scatter plot was nice exercise. I had to dig into eigenvectors. Such as using eigen basis may later be useful tool.	Sample covariance matrix result was confusing as it differs from numpy.cov	4 : 10-20 hours
sample covariance matrix&nbsp; and eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrixIn the exercises ,Task 3 - Eigenvectors is the best part of the round. It prepared for PCA in later course and give a detail iimpressure of the concept&nbsp; "eigenvalue" and how to calculate even though the Maths part of this is a bit difficult.	In topic 2.3    Loss Function and Empirical Risk, especially for loss function in this section, it might be too much information together for a beginner and a bit difficult to understand at once.&nbsp; But it is good to have them and read them together after learn all parts of the course and can get a overall and deeper understanding.In addition, it would be nice to give Maths exercises garages in the beginning of the course would help a lot.	4 : 10-20 hours
Notebook is easy to use and goor learning environment. It is easy to use ad the focus is on the task itself.	Basic matrix operations.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I think features and labels we''re explained well through the apples and Shazam examples'	The lectures with just math scribbling	4 : 10-20 hours
Coding Assignnment and getting the results correct was rewarding.	Matrix and vector calculations because they can be quite tricky.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Coding excercise although I don''t prefer the jupiter platform.You learn by doing.'	'This one. It''s hard to answer.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Features, very well explained	Loss function could have been gone through a bit more thoroughly	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 1 - Plotting. Here it is possible to apply maths and try to implement formula.	All exercises and topics are given in a good way.	1 : less than 1 hour
coding, its fun!	nothing bad so far	3 : 6-10 Hours
'It was very good to immediately get references to python libraries needed for ML. Tools ready right away.It''s also good to be able to freely choose toolset used. I''m using PyCharm and I can run exercises perfectly there. Also it''s ready then for my work.'	'It would be good to have references to "thick" university textbooks that are recommended to be read along with course book. For me it''s easier to read when there are lots of descriptions and examples, in addition to course book. But it''s difficult to choose the perfect book. If there are references that would be good. Reference to Goodfellow book was very valuable.Spelling in course book:p72 ch8.1 “Fist” vs. first  p.16 “is is”  p.22 Figure 2.3 - there is no 2.3'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Exercise 3 was the best part. It was nice to make use of the powerful Python libraries. I also liked Friday''s lecture a lot. I really made the concepts of hypothesis space an loss function clear.'	In the quizz, there was a question about the properties of a matrix C=X(transpose)X. It was not covered in the lectures, nor the course book, so it felt a little off topic at the moment.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Loss function : core component of how to optimize ML model	Hypothesis space : I had a lot of troubles understanding how to calculate the number of elements in the hypothesis space	2 : 1-5 hours
Coding exercises. It provides concrete skills, not just theoretical knowledge.	'Coding exercises are not automatically checked, and they are not part of grading. I''m also doing Stanford University ML course at the moment which is based on automatically checked coding exercises, which is great because the grading is based on concrete results that you need to do in real life. Plagiarism checking of code should also be automatic.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Getting familiar with the matplotlib and numpy libraries.	There was not a worst part.	2 : 1-5 hours
In General whole assignments was useful for me because i was pushed to learn Python. 	I guess some part of assignment was use less for example if i can draw a plot with three different subset I can draw for whole subset definitely.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Very detailed knowledge of hypothesis space and it''s crucial role in the design of ML. Great!'	I did not find anything bad in the course. Everything is very well organized, and lectures and exercised are designed in a way so that one may gain the basic understanding of the ML algorithms and quickly apply them in the exercises, which are carefully crafted so as to enable the learner to execute them in jupyter notebooks.I think the last exercise of eigen vector and eigen value calculation was good, but one may have perhaps highlighted the significance of eigen vector in ML, for ex., its role in PCA and others.	4 : 10-20 hours
Hypothesis Space. Because it is often skipped in other ML courses.	I think they were the same.	2 : 1-5 hours
Features, labels and hypothesis were well explained in lecture and in the book.	'I couldn''t see the connection with eigenvectors to what we discussed at lecture. They were really hard to understand since it''s been ages from matrix algebra.'	4 : 10-20 hours
It was nice to understand the logic behind machine learning.	Invertible matrix, identity matrix and so on... Course material could contain some better examples in these area.	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 3 - Eigenvectors. In addition of introducing new concept, the task required you to understand all previous exercises.	'Task 0 - Matrices and Vectors. It was easy to skip through this exercise, since it didn''t specify anything to do for the student. Link to the numpy docs would''ve sufficed and served us better.'	2 : 1-5 hours
FeaturesI think I have know how&nbsp;numeric features can be expressed as vectors and how they can be applied in ML in simple cases.	Hypothesis Space&nbsp;I do not understand much of that.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The calculation of the eigenvectors of the data was a good recap of how eigenvectors work.	'Worst part was that I hadn''t used python before so it took quite long to do the exercise.'	4 : 10-20 hours
I found that the information on the Loss function, as presented in class was really interesting, even if I need to work to understand it some more to be sure of my level of understanding, the description in class really laid out the foundation for me.&nbsp;	I found myself a little lost going through the third task of the exercise, I had to work closely with the TAs and some classmates to make sure that I understood both how to complete the exercise and what the reasoning behind it was.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
The last section of the notebook (eigenvectors and eigenvalues) -- was a nice refresher and I liked the interactivity.	'The quiz question on features was a bit subjective ("Features are properties of data points (such as a webcam snapshot) which can be measured easily.") as it''s not always true. Maybe qualify the statement with an "often" or "usually"?'	2 : 1-5 hours
The eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix and the eigenvectors visualization. I believe this gives a good intuition about how this works, especially in algorithms like PCA. I also liked the case of matrix invertibility.	Some quiz questions were unnecessarily tricky, like the one with the eigenvectors.	2 : 1-5 hours
'I didn''t find any exercise particularly "interesting". I think it''s a very good thing that you gave us the first exercises as a pandas/numpy/matplotlib recap (or familiarization).'	'Again, there weren''t any bad exercises. Maybe the only problem was the&nbsp;uncertainty of our answers&nbsp;correctness, but that has been already fixed to some degree with asserts in the second round.'	2 : 1-5 hours
All the python based assignments.I enjoyed learning the language and testing its possibilities	'Hypothesis space is something I''m struggling with. In general, I''m not a textbook-reading person.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I think the various graphing methods (scatter plot, line plot etc.) were the best part of the exercise. I think those really make those abstract matrixes and such visually understandable. And also teaches early one easy and quick data verification tool.	'The last part of the exercise where it asks to draw the two eigen vectors: I got stuck there because I was trying to implement it using pandas, which has plotting functions based "DataFrames". It got complicated quickly in the end, until I realised it''s probably meant to be done with the mathplotlib.pyplot, where there is direct plot function which is much straightforward to use. A hint could have been useful.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the eigen vectors part of excercise as I looking at the implementation in the notebook and actually plotting it gave better insights into understanding the concept which I wanted to learn in detail. I got a better understanding of that.&nbsp;	I would not say worse but as I already knew basic stuff, the matrices and vectors was a repetition for me but other than that I did not find any difficulty. For Eigenvectors, I was expecting little more detail in the course book or some other references to study it.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The question 18 in the questionnaire contained completely new concepts to me, such as hypothesis space, so it was good to&nbsp; have a simple question about this (and not too hard questions too early). 	The question 16 in the questionnaire was maybe too simple.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 3 from the exercise because it was a perfect exercise to refresh basics of statistics and linear algebra. And a good introduction into feature space because with the exercise I could see how ML people analyze feature space in the beginning to get an overview of what kind of correlation there is. Which makes it easier later to choose a good hypothesis map	Understanding&nbsp;the terminology of ML. Because coming from the sensor side I already learned a lot of different definitions for the same thingsand now with ML there is another whole new definition. I think it helps to have a good example like Roomba so I can imagine a real life scenario where ML data is coming from(actual sensor like the camera from Roomba) and how to apply ML in real world.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours

The example with apple drawing recognition was tangible and easy to follow, I liked the teaching style with the drawing software, keep it up!	'First lecture''s ppt. slides - not as good medium to present to us the main problematics.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I think the exercises to work out the matrix manipulations and computations were the best part because they really helped me review and remember matrices after a long time, so it was good to apply the math into the code. It was a good introduction to handling this type of data structure in code, and after the later lectures and seeing the next exercise I can really see how useful it was to have this as a practice introduction in handling matrix operations.	'I think the worst part was maybe not a topic or exercise precisely but it did take me awhile to understand the notations and language since it had been a while since I''d taken linear algebra courses( about 3-4 years ago when I was doing my bachelors). It would have been nice to maybe have had the matrix cookbook before the class started and the heads up about knowing certain linear algebra concepts ahead of time.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Doing the fill in the blank work for basic exercises	The round was very basic for people with prior knowledge, but it seems to help others completely&nbsp;new to ML and coding&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
I loved the course was arranged that a person who is new to python could do the task and stepwise task to build the concepts was really nice. I loved plotting the graphs in the exercises.&nbsp;	I did not appreciate&nbsp;the question in the quiz to find the typos.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'Examination of the Eigenvectors for a covariance space. I didn''t know about this technique before and it seems to be an elegant way to summarizing data point clouds.'	'Probably estimating the hypothesis space size. It wasn''t really clear what we had to do there.'	2 : 1-5 hours
I enjoyed doing the coding assignment. It was a useful recap of the topics covered. I did appreciate the fact that most of the code was provided for us, so that we could focus on the essential part - understanding the theory. And, of course, it also helps to learn Python better.	The one for finding typos was strange. But I do realize that the main goal was to ensure people read the chapters, so I guess it makes sense.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Understanding that ML is about finding labels.&nbsp;	'Most of the mathy talk in the book and in the lecture. It seemed over-complicated and I would''ve liked it to be explained simply first, and then in detail. "This loss function is 0 when we''re here and 1 here and..." made it tough to understand that it''s just "if the answer is wrong, loss is 1".'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The Jupyter notebook is really convenient as it helps to start faster and avoid setup problems.	I think it would be better to indicate the number of correct answers if multiple in the quiz.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The scatter plot was pretty interesting, and a good way to introduce the relationship between features or between features and labels.&nbsp;	'The matrix initial questions on the quiz, because there wasn''t content about it either in the book or in the jupyter notebook.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Features and labels were well described so that even with students with no previous experience could understand	The hypothesis space was too difficult for me to understand	2 : 1-5 hours
I found them all equally good.	None, since I think they were all equally good.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Hypothesis space, it is a good idea of search a solution in the big hypothesis space.	Algebra part, it is not explained in the book well.	1 : less than 1 hour
The python&nbsp;notebook problems where interesting to solve.	The math aspect of the machine learning could have been explained a bit more in detail.	2 : 1-5 hours
The Basics were well put out and defined and the exercises were well defined as well&nbsp;	Nothing as such comes to mind	3 : 6-10 Hours
The exercise. It can help me practice and understand the concepts further.	The lecture. It is not specific in the mathematics part.	4 : 10-20 hours
The apple drawing topic. As I am concerned, it was interesting and easy to understand features, labels, loss function and hypothesis. And it made me understand the theme of machine learning.	The coding part. Without background of python programming, I have to search a lot of functions and try to fit them into the code. I thought it was a little exhausting and inefficient.	5 : more than 20 hours
'Very hard to pick best part. Reading the textbook felt like there''s much to learn. Every now and then there was a note "Look chapter 2+x". '	'Loss functions could be in their own chapter. They could also be opened a bit more. Though I''m not sure if it was intentional that at the start, we are introduced to idea that they exist and there are some well known solutions.&nbsp; '	4 : 10-20 hours
The exercise for quiz 1 was a very good refresher for revising python functions and matrices.	Nothing specific	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 3 in the exercise. It gives good example of eigenvectors and help me to understand better.	The first plotting part, just for me because I already have experience on it.	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 0 1 and 2 were good. Got to know about how things work on python as this was my first experience.	'The eigenvalues part. I don''t get how we specified the values of the eigenvectors to plot the graph.'	2 : 1-5 hours
The Python Introduction, because I never wirked with python before and could easily get into it.	Understadning the coursebook takes some times and is the most difficult part yet.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked excercise one and two were really good explained. I have never used python but could fullfill the tasks.	The second question in the quiz was really hard.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the overall introduction to the subject.	The topic about the hypothesis space was hard to understand.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'For me the mathematical notations have allways been a struggle, due to laziness. Thanks to this course I have managed to force myself into improving on the aforesaid lack.When it comes to this round I felt that, as I didn''t know any Python in advance, making numpy etc. libraries familiar by the excersices was a good choice.'	It was sort of difficult to see the big picture whilst doing the exercises. Afterwards it kinda started to make sence what each assignment was for.	4 : 10-20 hours
The best part of this round was the second and third task in the notebook material because the learned concepts could be used in the practice.	The matrices were hard to understand after a long break to the matrix algebra. I had to search lot of information online.	4 : 10-20 hours
example with calculating the confidence whether a drawing shows an applebecause it repeated the theory you have already learned before and gave some new insight	worst part was watching the recorded video of the first lecture as I could not attend first lecturefrom time to time the video just stopped for a few seconds and afterwards continued, in addition the big shown screen was&nbsp;freezed from minute 30 until the end	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I really liked the python assignment as It gave a lot of freedom to do things as I would prefer it. The python assigments were as expected more an intro into using python instead of actually using the ML libraries. I think this was a good introduction and I''m looking forward to getting started with some ML assignments.'	The first part of the quiz was very differenty from the contents of the reading sections and the python assigment. We were told to brush of our linear algebra during the last lecture of the week by which time I had already completed the quiz so the pointer came a little late. It would be useful if the recommended material to complete before starting the quiz was complete. This would improve the preparation and the also the value the quiz can bring as a test of your work on the course.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The general introduction helped a lot understanding the basic idea of features and labels. Especially the course book helped to understand it.	The quiz, as some questions were concerned with linear algebra. I could answer them correctly but was not expecting them at all in the quiz.	2 : 1-5 hours
The second Lecture "Drawing an Apple" because this realization really&nbsp;helps you to understand the topics	Trying to remember Algebra because even if I know the topic, I always can forget some details (such as scalar multiplication of an eigenvector is still same eigenvector)	3 : 6-10 Hours
My favourite topic of this round was Loss Functions, in particular their analytical and statistical properties.	'I was quite confused by the digression about the differences between neural networks versus decision trees, because I didn''t fully understand what a Neural Network is. I hope we will see something more about them in the future.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Gradient descent and linear regression, because I love how maths interact with computers also how data is visualized	jupyterhub, there were issues that I could run in my computer but not in the jupyterhub	3 : 6-10 Hours
The best part was the polynomial regression, because it was a generalization of the linear one, and it was interesting to notice how the predictino can change with the number of degrees in the function.	'I don''t think there was a part done badly, as everything was explained clearly.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
I guess best part was overall explaining of features and labels. I think machine learning as a concept is much more comprehensible after that.	After reading sections 1 and&nbsp; 2 from the course book and then completing the first quiz, I felt that I was unprepared for questions from quiz section "Matrices and Vectors". Other sections were much more clear.	3 : 6-10 Hours
-0	As someone who has worked on machine learning problems for work, the hypothesis space way of explaining machine learning, while correct, is not a very intuitive way of explaining machine learning.	2 : 1-5 hours
I really enjoyed the Jupyter Notebook exercise, good introduction to the libraries that are used in machine learning.	Eigenvalues and vectors and when matrix is invertible not fresh in the memory, some would have been nice.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The best part was the real life examples given throughout the lectures (number of apples on a tree based on a photo, image recognition based on a drawing...).	The worst part was perhaps the reading of the course book which was sometimes too detailed.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The hypothesis space is a very interesting approach to define the possible outputs that a ML algorithm can have	The covariance matrix and its properties were not explained well enough	3 : 6-10 Hours
2, i found something new	17, labels are easy to determine for people	2 : 1-5 hours
Coding Assignment -Task 3. This task not only helps me to know the methods of numpy, but also helps me to review the content of eigendecomposition.&nbsp;	Coding Assignment -Task 1. I thought there would be some function to help to solve the derivative, but in the end, I calculated it by hand.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I consider the task2 files is the best part of this round, for reading files especially CSV files is the prerequisite to do machine learning, I''ve learned data mining before, and I totally understand how important it is.'	I think the task 0 is not as good as I expected, for I almost forgot all the knowledge about linear algebra. So it will be better, if more exercises about basic knowledge of linear algebra are provided.	4 : 10-20 hours
I liked how the requirements also contained tips and help with the exercises that were more difficult.I liked the last exercise as it was more complex.	I had a little confusion in the last exercise because in the requirements the&nbsp; number of the requirements were different than they were commented in the code:&nbsp;[3.2.] Stack the feature vectors row-wise into the "feature matrix"&nbsp;X=(x(1),…,x(N))T∈ℝN×dX=(x(1),…,x(N))T∈RN×d.&nbsp; is not the same as it is in the code for number 2 :&nbsp;#Step 2: compute the sample covariance of data.Other than this small confusion, it was not difficult.	2 : 1-5 hours
Features.I learn a lot about it from the course book through the examples. The description is very easy to understand.	Hypothesis Space.It lacks some exercises.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Loss Function. Because I think this is the key to machine learning algorithms,&nbsp; I know the goal is to minimize the loss function and I know how to get weights based on the loss function.	'I don''t think there is any worst part of this round.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Being fairly new to ML and python, I found task 1 to be really well laid out to give you a solid foundation about how to visualise the matrices and vectors and got you started off on the right foot for the other tasks that needed to be preformed and how to do so in the system that it was in.&nbsp;Side note: Throughout the whole Task sets I also like how everything is laid out and you know where you are supposed to put in your code - for people who were a little overwhelmed in the beginning, it was really great to see that even when the TAs are not around, there is still guidance so you were not totally stuck - you had some hints to google or look into the course book about.&nbsp;	I would not go as far to say the worst part but a section that was more difficult for me was that of Eigenvectors. (This may also be partly due to the fact that I started the second assignment) ... but in the second assignment it tells you what formula to execute in the code for the second (linear regression - 3.3 I believe). This could have also been linked in the question to help the students gain a better idea which formula they should code out. Looking back at the quiz and reading the sections again, it is a little more clear, but I think linking it to Equation 1 could have made the process a little faster but also give confidence that the student is working the right way.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
The general description of a machine learning problem was very interesting. I really appreciate that it follows a mathematical scheme and thus is very easy to understand.	I think all the topic/exercices were ok.	2 : 1-5 hours
I enjoyed the exercises, it was a nice "look into" how to start basic implementation of theoretical concepts.	It went a bit fast for a beginner.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Loss function!	NA	3 : 6-10 Hours
all python exercises (practical stuff)	cannot complain, this course is good :D	4 : 10-20 hours
Overview of the features and labels was interesting.	'The course book''s parts about loss function and hypothesis space were very burdensome to read.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Going into easily-understandable details about the mathematical background and not just mindlessly coding.	In the coding task, the text description of some tasks was inconsistent with the description in the code comment.	4 : 10-20 hours
Notebook in general is very good practical exercise that easily allow to grasp some basics of ML.	Maybe it would be nice if there will be some exercise based on real-life problem to better feel the subjects of ML.	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 3 from the Jupyter notebook was the best part of this round for me. In this exercise you had to read a csv file from the disk to the python module in order to make "data analysis".After that you had to transform the data from the csv file to numpy matrix and compute the covariance matrix using the given equation. After the function that gives the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix C, you had to plot a scatter with the data loaded and the arrows showing the eigenvectors. I think that it was a really good start which exams a big range of knowledge in python, linear algebra and thinking.	I think that I did not find a useless part from this round. All exercises were good enough to help you start with the course.	3 : 6-10 Hours
In my opinion Task 2 was the best one. Doing this task we learn to first plot the data in its entirety to see if with the naked eye we can already simplify the problem. Sometimes we might get carried away asking the machine to do all the work, but we must remember that we, as humans coding, play a huge part.	'The worst part, in my opinion, was that I wasn''t able to correlate the theoretical lesson with the exercises. I liked them both separately, but I think that the lesson presented lots of topics without getting into detail and then the exercises didn''t really get into detail for most of the things either. Maybe it was because it was an introductory class and we will be going into more detail during the course.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The exercise on eigenvalues and eigenvectors was a good revision of linear algebra concepts.	One of the quiz questions was a bit annoying, i believe it was question 3 which asked which was the right graph for the function. There were 3 options which were very similar to each other, which ended up being a test of intense observational skills instead of a conceptual or programming test.&nbsp;	2 : 1-5 hours
Task-2 was best part for me because i have learnt different plotting styles and how to make subsets of matrix.	Loss function and hypothesis space was tough for me. I had little idea about these things that why these bit complicated to me. I am trying to get more knowledge related to these thing through internet and books. 	3 : 6-10 Hours
Gradient Descent method.&nbsp;Was able to follow very well	Regarding Hypothesis Space.Pretty confused about the formulation of Hypothesis Space	3 : 6-10 Hours
'My favourite exercise was the task 3 out of the round''s notebook. What I liked about it was that you learn how to work with the data and make calculations first and then how to visualize the obtained results.'	'Well, the exercise was done well and everything was understandable. The only problem I had was initially with the Question 5 from Quiz. At first, I didn''t understand that you just have to work with the outcomes of this task, but when I realized it, it was clear and easy. Question 11 was tricky, requiring some additional knowledge, but I guess it is okay.'	2 : 1-5 hours
'JupyterHub - I like the idea of having to do the code before being able to do the quiz. I accepted that I haven''t done the code but I took the opportunity of having 3 attempts and a bit of previous knowledge in ML to do the quiz.'	'JupyterHub - if you don''t really have enough time to do the code, you can''t do the quiz. I also don''t like the typos questions. I can''t seem to find any typos and I am not sure if not finding anything is right or wrong.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 3 on eigan vectors was the best part for me. This is because it helped me learn the various plots in python and get my basics right.	Understanding of loss functions in the course book was the hardest for me since it found it difficult to follow what was written.	2 : 1-5 hours
I enjoyed the first lecture and introduction into the topic of machine learning. Together with the script, it was well described what is the essence of Machine Learning and made me curious to learn how to actually solve a Machine Learning Problem.&nbsp;	There was no "worse part" per se but I wished that before starting this course, more detailed information on how to prepare for it would have been given. The prerequisite of "Data Science" might not be given for students from diverse tracks or different backgrounds, hence more precise information on what to refresh in Linear Algebra or how to familiarise oneself with Python would have been useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
'The first exercise is the best part of this round since it is a good entry for the students who don''t know how to use the numpy and are not familiar with Python grammar like me. It shows a good example.'	'I think the worst part of this round is the exercise1. Because some of us haven''t learned how to draw those ''plots'', so we need to search and check a lot of information to make sure how to use it and whether the results we have got were right. I think maybe after finishing the quiz there should be some correct answer for us to check.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Get to know Jupyter notebooks.	Having to review a little bit of algebra.	2 : 1-5 hours
Features were easiest to understand	Loss function was most difficult to understand	4 : 10-20 hours
assignment exercises because they give a brief of linear algebra	the last parts about plotting data in Jupyter Notebook for Beginners.&nbsp;	5 : more than 20 hours
Task 3 in Python assignment- It taught me useful function&nbsp;about finding eigenvalues and vector for a given matrix	no comment	4 : 10-20 hours
Every topic in this section was covered through exercise and good practical knowledge obtained	Very lengthy because questions were based on the tasks from exercise so solving every one of them is a big task.	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I don''t really have preferred a part of this round over the other. This round was an introductive one, and I think it was graet to learn the basics of Machine Learning and python.And having examples in the book we have to read is great to help understand some notions.'	'The worst part would be the book we have to read : there is a lot to read and there are a lot of informations. I didn''t have any notions of ML, and it was not always easy. But by taking some time to review this a little, it should do.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Since I am not very familiar with python, I think just getting the basics of basic file management and also variables and how to do basic operations, and I would say this exercise covered it all.	I was a bit confused since my eigenvectors looked a bit off for some reason, and that was probably the most confusing part for me (but not a big deal anyway, overall this exercise was quite simple).	2 : 1-5 hours
'The difference between feature and label even if it''s complicated.'	Some definition are complicated for example the definition of label or loss function. I think the example are a little bit too complicated.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The data visualization. Python makes it very easy and fast.	Actually there was no bad part of this round.	4 : 10-20 hours
Last few questions(Q13- Q18) about features, label space, hypothesis space and loss function were the best part. It was taught well in class and also in the lecture notes.&nbsp;The questions were quite straightforward, so if you attend the class and read lecture notes you can easily get all of them right.&nbsp;	Eigen vector part was tougher, it has been a long time since I have studied matrices. To understand the concept of matrices, then figure out how to do the coding in python and then the quiz was the most challenging.&nbsp;Although some material related to matrices and vectors was provided it was too vast and time consuming to go through entire material.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
The scatterplot in task 2 was pretty fun, because I like working with python. You can get so much done with so little code.	Question 2 was a little more challenging as I forgot a lot of the theory I learned in other semesters of my studies.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the programming exercise. Especially the third one was interesting.	'The lecture sometimes is too slow and I start getting bored so I''m not shure weather I''ll attend the next lectures or read through the textbook myself.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Plotting data to visualize it. During my university career so far, I had to program based on data, but we also used it for higher-level purposes, so that we never really worked with the basic data. It was fun to see which results are already accessible at this stage.	Eigenvectors. Actually there was no really worst part, but eigenvectoren was the less fun :) 	4 : 10-20 hours
I really liked the approach to the Hypothesis Space. Never thought about how basically all machine learning techniques are very similar and can be distinguished by a set of hypotheses. 	'The derivation of gradient descent, even though very important, didn''t really fit in with the overview nature of the first round. '	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The 3rd exercise related to the eigenvectors, as I''d no clue they had any utility since i''m bad at algebra.Also having basic tutorials for the programs we''re going ot use all semester is great idea to have!'	'The 3rd exercise, since I realised I didn''t understand anything of algebra. Also I think repeating a lot of stuff in theoretical classes in confusing nad time consuming'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The 3rd exercise was good to understand the eigenvectors and their utility	The 3rd part was the most difficult	2 : 1-5 hours
Getting to know the matplotlib library	None	2 : 1-5 hours
I cannot pick a single argument because everything is connected as a whole, but I am really liking the course and how to build ML problems	I had some problems with the assignment because I have never learned python, but thanks to google I could fix my ignorance of python	4 : 10-20 hours
For me the best part was brief introduction to the most important libraries for Machine Learning, especially Task2.	Exercise 3, it was the most time consuming.	2 : 1-5 hours
I think the graph plotting is a very good introduction to the following topic because we gonna use it many times in the future.	None	3 : 6-10 Hours
I liked the exercise and learning python because it is a new program for me and i think it is importent to kow it.	i cant think of the worst part.&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I liked the way exercises are organized. I''ve never programmed in python before and it was easy to follow the instructions while learning to code in python with the resources provided'	'Algebra. I had forgotten most of my algebra knowledge, so I had to spend more time than I expected on refreshing those concepts. (I know it has nothing to do with the round itself, but I can''t say anything I disliked)'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The Cleaning Roboter in the Office Room, mentioned in the course book. The example is cute.	The discussion of decision boundaries does not appear in one place in the course book, but is scattered seemingly unstructured around chapter 2.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The Cleaning Roboter in the Office Room, mentioned in the course book. The example is cute.	The discussion of decision boundaries does not appear in one place in   the course book, but is scattered seemingly unstructured around chapter   2.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The coding assignment in general. It was very&nbsp; helpful to have an introductionary round such as this to catch-up on coding skills.	The eigenvector exercise. I spent numerous trial-and-error attempts to&nbsp; get the result of the function in correct order. Would be more helpful if it was explained in what order the result of the .eig function is displayed. Unfortunately, onlune resources were also not clear about this, and I mistakenly believed the "transposed" version of the eigenvectors I found were the correct answers. Only the quiz question made me realize the mistake.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I like the questions about conceptual things such as understanding the main concepts the keywords.&nbsp;	I had hard time understanding the eigenvector part.	3 : 6-10 Hours
In general the exercise are very helpful to get familiar with the programming language due my poor experience with python.	Give the typo error was a bit tricky and laborious, but I think that its purpose is to make us read the book, which is good anyways.Also I am not sure about this,&nbsp; but could say that if the purpose of this course is to learn about ML, Matlab could be the best environment to learn	4 : 10-20 hours
REfreshing of algebra	Algebra	2 : 1-5 hours
Visualizing the data in different ways (scatter, histogram)	I fount the round well balanced so no bad feedback	4 : 10-20 hours
For me, it might be the exercise task 3 about the Eigenvectors. When I learn about the linear algebra, I learn about the definition of eigenvectors but still confused about how it works. With the coding assignment, I understand the meaning of it in a visualized way and its a new knowledge to me.&nbsp;	None. Some work seems to be hard for me but none is useless, so...	3 : 6-10 Hours
:)	:)	2 : 1-5 hours
the distinction between features and labels	'there wasn''t any'	2 : 1-5 hours
//	The first two questions in the quiz were about matrix dimensions, rank & inversions. My algebra courses were a long time ago, maybe some theoretical refreshment in the exercise assignment?	2 : 1-5 hours
The example of Rumba in the course book helped well understanding the terms by a real example.	'can''t remember something worth mentioning.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I''m not sure if this counts, but I think the greatest part of this round was the second class, I think, when Alex realised that people haven''t understood some topics very well and then he made, from the scratch, an exercise about regression, with the apple example. It was amazing for me, because he took the feedback and still in the begging of the course he made a complete exercise, which really helps to completely understand the theory.'	'I couldn''t find a worst part, sorry.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
It was very interesting to calculate and plot the eigenvectors	'I haven''t used Python earlier. So, it was very demanding to do the exercises. I would have hoped, that there had been some tutorial to study. Now I had to study Python from many websites.And actually, I''m not sure if my way of coding was efficient at all.'	4 : 10-20 hours
The last question of the exercise was the best part. It helped me brush up my matrices concepts(Eigenvectors ).	Nothing.	4 : 10-20 hours
I would say the task 3 of the notebook where we had to plot the different data points and see how the first eigenvector captures the dimension with bigger variance of the dataset. The why is because it lets to see the graphical view of a mathematic concept which it will be useful in the future to apply dimension reduction techniques such as PCA.	None in particular, I would just point out that maybe more detailed information about inverse matrix and advantages of having an inverse matrix would be helpful.	2 : 1-5 hours
exercise 3 (eigenvectors), because it is a cool application of linear algebra 	exercise 1, because plotting functions is boring	3 : 6-10 Hours
Options. All the options to attend or view lectures. To do exercises in the garages or at home or online. With the help of slack or without. But I guees that is true for all the rounds, so I also enjoyed Roomba example and not jus having mathematical notation to better understand basics of ML.	The questions regarding the matrices seemed a bit out of the blue for in the quiz. Although 3 attempts still is a good deal.	2 : 1-5 hours
The best part was to learn how to use python libraries related to machine learning.	There werent any bad parts about this round. The notebook was helpfull and quite clear. THe explanations made on the lectures and the course book was also helpful and clear.	3 : 6-10 Hours
The examples (i.e.&nbsp;2.1.3 Example: Cryptocurrencies and the Rumba examples) are very helpful in clarifying many of the concepts talked about in the text.	Some of the chapters (i.e.&nbsp;2.2 Hypothesis Space) are slightly cluttered in a way that makes it difficult to figure out the main points of the text.	4 : 10-20 hours
The concept of feature vector and space was clearly explained&nbsp;	There was a little difficulty in comprehending the concept hypothesis space and what size it could have&nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Question 18 about hypothesis space. It helps me to understand more about how to calculate the number of elements in hypothesis space.	none	1 : less than 1 hour
Eigenvectors and their visualization. I just love to see how neatly it tells the concept of variance and capturing most of it with the help of decomposition.&nbsp;	The worst part for me was the html layout of the test, which totally confused me about which plot is "a", which is "b" etc., screwed two attempts because of that :D	2 : 1-5 hours
'The JupyterHub. It''s convenient.'	Nothing.	2 : 1-5 hours
I like the way how the assignment is presented. Very clear and also ask students to explore themselves.&nbsp;	Too many mathematical notions that I wish they could have been clarified more.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
I like the lectures. They give very good insight and understanding of the main point of the Course book and exercises.	Matirx manipulation has never been in my highest interest. Would need more concentration and learning of mathmatics.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 2 - Files: I liked to work with subsets of data.	Task 3 - Eigenvectors: More complex. I had some trouble with the exercise 3.5 and the direction of the eigenvectors (it does not seem clear).	3 : 6-10 Hours
'I liked how we were provided with a working "algorithm" for the complete analysis of a ML problem, from the definition of the data''s features to the choice of a suitable loss function and hypothesis space.'	I would have liked also a "more practical" part in each lecture, showing us how everything explained work on real data (as we are doing by ourselves in the notebooks).	2 : 1-5 hours
Plotting!As data scientist it will be a commun task in our work	I would say Math stuff, last time I studied math was about 4 years ago, it would be nice to have some slides with some basic we should know (not necessary to teach it during the lessons, just some slides in the platform)	3 : 6-10 Hours
shazam analogy.Provides an example of ML usage in real world.	800+ people enrolled at the course.&nbsp;If you are a little too late, could be hard to find an empty seat	3 : 6-10 Hours
'The second part, because it''s very interesting to bring raw data to graphics that you can obtain a lot of information (for example, a distribution of the data using a histogram)'	'I enjoyed all the parts, so i don''t think that there is a worst part'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The best part was definitely the example of classification of pictures of apples. I think it was the most fun example of machine learning so far.	The loss function explanation was way too "mathy" for me.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I found the lecture on Friday 14th very good. The method of describing an typical machine learning problem together worked really well for me.	The part where the loss-function was explained was not clear to me the first time. Maybe you could take more time to explain this topic.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I really liked the python tasks, well written and they revolved around implementations that are not only useful for Machine Learning, but can be used for other courses as well.	'I''m not sure if the questions about any typos are graded, or if they are just there for feedback. I couldn''t find any typos and i searched over and over.'	4 : 10-20 hours
For me, actually, the best part of this round was less about the ML concepts and more about the first touch with Phyton, because I had never used (although I used C and matlab at quite a good level) and I found the explanations very complete and useful	I would not say there worst parts.	2 : 1-5 hours
I think the programming exercises are good, because they helped me know more about python and machine learning	I think there are no worst part.	3 : 6-10 Hours
Questions 14, 16, 17, 18 were good because they sum up the general ideas for features, labels and hypothesis space.&nbsp;So the material of your book is better entrenched in my mind.	'I didn''t remember bad questions. All these parts were important for the current topics as I think.But the second question was too mathematical. It first confused me why only mathematics in ML. But then other topics were considered.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Loss Function was explained by the professor very good. Easy understanding why it that necessary for machine learning.	'Couldn''t perfectly understand what the hypothesis space is exatly in the first lecture. But the Teacher explained it very good in the second lecture.'	4 : 10-20 hours
The best part was the python notebook for my part, I find it easier to understand the theory using a practical approach.	The end of the apple example, it was personally getting harder to follow the end as the drawing was getting packed and kept going back to previous drawing and back to the new one. When looking at the drawing again later on, it was hard to find back the flow.	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 2 Files. I think this is the best because it teaches us the basic of separating and seeing the data. I think we will needed this in the next rounds. 	'I don''t think that there were any worst parts but if i have to choose i choose Task 1- plotting.&nbsp;I choose this exercise because i don''t think it had any value it learns you to plot but that also happens in Task 2. So i don''t think it is necessary. '	3 : 6-10 Hours
In Chapter 2 the elements of a ML problem are well defined.	Maybe even more real-life examples could be provided.	4 : 10-20 hours
Plotting data with python. One could immediately see the results and if the code worked or not. Although a little more explanation on the libraries and their specific functions would have been nice. Like this, we/I had to do a lot of research and just googleing for those tasks.&nbsp;	Eigenvectors: As a business student I am not that familiar with the mathematical terms and exercises.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
The theoretical questions for me are the best part of this Quiz, as they allow ourselfs to test if we really understood the concepts explained in the Lectures. Also, from my point of view, the last lectures seen on Regression and Classification, with the examples of the Apple drawing have been incredibly useful for settling down the important concepts of a ML problem.	The Mathematical (algebra) parts, as most students I Think have forgetten those and have had to look them up again. Maybe a small document could be given to help us refresh old knowledge in these areas.	4 : 10-20 hours
Features/labels were well explained and this is important because it is the basics	I think the Lost functions lost me a bit but maybe because it simply is the hardest part of the lecture	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the programming exercise. I have never worked with python before and it was fun to learn programming in python through the exercises.	I did not really like the part about the logistic loss because it was not easy to understand with the book.&nbsp;	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 2.FilesI think it was the best part beacause manipulating data and doing several kinds of plots was interesting.	'Task 0Because i didn''t learned anything since there were no practice.&nbsp;'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked to learn the various applications of machine learning and this introduction helped me understand how a lot of things can be done	None	3 : 6-10 Hours
The way notes have been introduced thanks to examples	nothing	3 : 6-10 Hours
The definition of all the notions essentials for Machine Learning was very clear and understandable. There will be no problem in the future to remember this basic notion.	'The overview of some ML problems:&nbsp; it was quite good but a lot of articles, books and courses have already introduced that. But it''s still useful for some people who don''t know that.&nbsp;'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked exercise 3 as I felt that it was not only about using some specific functions but you had to understand what you were doing in order to get it right. It was really nice to practice some basic skills with Python and I really like the format of the exercises.&nbsp;	'I don''t really know what to improve in this round. If I have to pick one exercise I would pick exercise 1, just because it was not very exciting.'	3 : 6-10 Hours
The Files topic is the best part for me because in that topic we familiarize ourselves with the data that we have.	'Can''t think of a topic that stands out as worst. I think they are all important.'	1 : less than 1 hour
The topic that I consider to be the best part in&nbsp;&nbsp;"Files" because there we actually examine the data and visualize it to get a better understanding of what we are dealing with	'I can''t think of one'	2 : 1-5 hours
'I think all the topics were essential and can''t choose the best one.'	'I can''t choose a worst one because all of them are equally important'	2 : 1-5 hours
I liked the quiz, it covered&nbsp; the material from the book and from the programming assignment&nbsp;	'The worst part for me was the one where I had to plot eigenvectors&nbsp;because I lost in coordinates, but that''s only my fault :)'	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 2. Because of data representation	Task 3. The algebra parts was the most difficult part, maybe because the low understanding about the topic	3 : 6-10 Hours
Hypothesis spaces. I liked the way the infinite possibilities were narrowed down in the second lecture, by using RMS.	I was not so familiar with the relevant maths and it really required effort to learn the necessities. Fortunately succeeded at least for now..	5 : more than 20 hours
I liked the numpy library uses and the explanations on the link provided.	plots	3 : 6-10 Hours
Functions of numpy	I dont know python	4 : 10-20 hours
The best part for me was exercise 1.3. I liked the recapitulation of matrices with various operations and the complexity of the exercise.	The worst part of this round was exercise 1.1 which was very easy and could have been enriched by a more challenging&nbsp;question in this exercise.	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 3 - Eigenvectors, I really appreciate to munipulate the matrix in order to find the result and plot everything. I think this exercise is very usefull.	'The first task - ploting for me was not the best. I didn''t really undertand if we have to use the np library or do the&nbsp;derivative by ourself'	3 : 6-10 Hours
Task 3 it help me learn about eigen values and vector	The linear algebra formula while explaining the gradient decent, I am not from math background so I have to learn linear algebra first	3 : 6-10 Hours
In general, the support/help given to solve the exercises (the included code, the theory and the advise about what functions to use) is very good to focus in what we have to. I wish all the courses followed this teaching/learning methodology.	In the Eigenvectors exercises, it is not so easy to understand (visually and in theory) what we are getting with them. It would be great that the support in the exercise included a brief explanation of this.	4 : 10-20 hours
I think the best part is plot task. Because I learned how to define and plot a function and visualized the data so than I can understand the data in more detail.	'I think the options of a question in quiz is wrong, because I can''t find the right answer in my code.'	2 : 1-5 hours

lecture: Very general definition of hypothesis spaces, emphasises the wideness of the machine learning field.exercise: i.g. using Jupyter notebook (&lt;3!) by far the most elegant, easy-to-get-started and nicest-to-read way for this kind of tasks I know.	lecture: definition of features and labels was really repetitive, I assume the last one got it on the second timeexercise: computing and visualising eigenvectors of the covariance matrix - useful while at the same time visually intuitive &nbsp;	3 : 6-10 Hours
Learning to use matplotlib was good for me. A refresher for derivatives was required and encouraged me to go back to the basics.	Eigen values and vectors. Too much time was required to be spent to go back to the basics.	4 : 10-20 hours
Task 3 - eigenvectors was the most interesting part.	There were no bad parts.	2 : 1-5 hours
Getting started with python.	No complaints.	2 : 1-5 hours
Task 2 and 3, because of the possibility to visualize what I was learning	Trying to find the typos to answer two of the questions of the quiz	4 : 10-20 hours
'The exercises were kind of deceptively easy. I could''ve done a little more exercises on topics that were not covered, such as loss functions.'	There is really no challenge in the exercise 1.	3 : 6-10 Hours
I do not have any clear preference.	I do not have any clear preference. 	2 : 1-5 hours
Loss function can be considered one topic since those are achieved mathematically. So knowing the theory it would be easy to find and work on it!	Knowing and finding, also working with features and labels are difficult since one to another it can be different. Also they can be too much which in this case their handling will be trouble!	3 : 6-10 Hours
I really enjoyed learning about jupyter, pandas, and matplotlib. That has to be the best thing about the exercise garage. All of these are extensively used libraries/softwares, and to add them to my skill set is satisfying. I will read more on these topics and try to get a better understanding/	'The question&nbsp;on&nbsp;hypothesis space was quite ambiguous. I''ll try to spend more time reading about it and then try to answer the question, but at the moment I am not quite able to understand the question. Apart from that, everything was pretty good and relevant.'	2 : 1-5 hours
Features was nice, as you have to decide which features are good for your learning and which are not. you get to tell the computer to learn on certain features	nothing as such was a worst part	2 : 1-5 hours
Eigenvector and eigenvalue. To me it is interested to see the trend (direction, magnitude) of a dataset just by looking at those values.	Eigenvector and eigenvalue as well. I did not fully comprehend it at first because the explanation was not really clear. The exercise solved this problem.	2 : 1-5 hours
The hands-on exercises are great.	'The course book was not that easy to read sometimes, maybe could be somehow rephrased or reorganized to allow more "flow reading".Also, I didn''t understand why in the 1.round quiz there were questions about the properties of matrices etc.? These were not handled in the course material... more like math course questions.'	4 : 10-20 hours
Easiest to start with file manipulations and plotting of Task 2 as first coding attempt with Python.&nbsp;	Due lack of time to finish properly I had difficulties with eigenvalues task. Long time from last math session.	4 : 10-20 hours
JupyterHub sections 1-2.I really enjoyed fiddling with the different options and testing own parameters.Using well prepared JupyterHub is just great!	EigenvectorsReason: My long forgotten math skills did not support me	4 : 10-20 hours
